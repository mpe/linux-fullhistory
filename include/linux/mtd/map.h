/* The map stuff is very simple. You fill in your struct map_info with
   a handful of routines for accessing the device, making sure they handle
   paging etc. correctly if your device needs it. Then you pass it off
   to a chip driver which deals with a mapped device - generally either
   do_cfi_probe() or do_ram_probe(), either of which will return a 
   struct mtd_info if they liked what they saw. At which point, you
   fill in the mtd->module with your own module address, and register 
   it.
   
   The mtd->priv field will point to the struct map_info, and any further
   private data required by the chip driver is linked from the 
   mtd->priv->fldrv_priv field. This allows the map driver to get at 
   the destructor function map->fldrv_destroy() when it's tired
   of living.
