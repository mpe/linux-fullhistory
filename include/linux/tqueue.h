/*
 * New proposed "bottom half" handlers:
 * (C) 1994 Kai Petzke, wpp@marie.physik.tu-berlin.de
 *
 * Advantages:
 * - Bottom halfs are implemented as a linked list.  You can have as many
 *   of them, as you want.
 * - No more scanning of a bit field is required upon call of a bottom half.
 * - Support for chained bottom half lists.  The run_task_queue() function can be
 *   used as a bottom half handler.  This is for example useful for bottom
 *   halfs, which want to be delayed until the next clock tick.
 *
 * Problems:
 * - The queue_task_irq() inline function is only atomic with respect to itself.
 *   Problems can occur, when queue_task_irq() is called from a normal system
 *   call, and an interrupt comes in.  No problems occur, when queue_task_irq()
 *   is called from an interrupt or bottom half, and interrupted, as run_task_queue()
 *   will not be executed/continued before the last interrupt returns.  If in
 *   doubt, use queue_task(), not queue_task_irq().
 * - Bottom halfs are called in the reverse order that they were linked into
 *   the list.
