		processing. So I insert the pipe_inode_info so the

		the msdos_inode_info, but the clear winner here is
		the ext2_inode_info. So it does not change anything to
		the total size of a struct inode.

		I have not put it conditional. With the advent of loadable
		file system drivers, it would be very easy to compile
		a MsDOS FS driver unaware of UMSDOS and then later to
		load a (then incompatible) UMSDOS FS driver.
