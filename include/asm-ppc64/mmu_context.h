/* VSID allocation
 * ===============
 *
 * We first generate a 36-bit "proto-VSID".  For kernel addresses this
 * is equal to the ESID, for user addresses it is:
 *	(context << 15) | (esid & 0x7fff)
 *
 * The two forms are distinguishable because the top bit is 0 for user
 * addresses, whereas the top two bits are 1 for kernel addresses.
 * Proto-VSIDs with the top two bits equal to 0b10 are reserved for
 * now.
 *
 * The proto-VSIDs are then scrambled into real VSIDs with the
 * multiplicative hash:
 *
 *	VSID = (proto-VSID * VSID_MULTIPLIER) % VSID_MODULUS
 *	where	VSID_MULTIPLIER = 268435399 = 0xFFFFFC7
 *		VSID_MODULUS = 2^36-1 = 0xFFFFFFFFF
 *
 * This scramble is only well defined for proto-VSIDs below
 * 0xFFFFFFFFF, so both proto-VSID and actual VSID 0xFFFFFFFFF are
 * reserved.  VSID_MULTIPLIER is prime, so in particular it is
 * co-prime to VSID_MODULUS, making this a 1:1 scrambling function.
 * Because the modulus is 2^n-1 we can compute it efficiently without
 * a divide or extra multiply (see below).
 *
 * This scheme has several advantages over older methods:
 *
 * 	- We have VSIDs allocated for every kernel address
 * (i.e. everything above 0xC000000000000000), except the very top
 * segment, which simplifies several things.
 *
 * 	- We allow for 15 significant bits of ESID and 20 bits of
 * context for user addresses.  i.e. 8T (43 bits) of address space for
 * up to 1M contexts (although the page table structure and context
 * allocation will need changes to take advantage of this).
 *
 * 	- The scramble function gives robust scattering in the hash
 * table (at least based on some initial results).  The previous
 * method was more susceptible to pathological cases giving excessive
 * hash collisions.
 */

/*
 * WARNING - If you change these you must make sure the asm
 * implementations in slb_allocate(), do_stab_bolted and mmu.h
 * (ASM_VSID_SCRAMBLE macro) are changed accordingly.
 *
 * You'll also need to change the precomputed VSID values in head.S
 * which are used by the iSeries firmware.
