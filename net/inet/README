This is snapshot 010

Notes:
ARP
	As of snapshot 006, ARP should compile and work correctly
	for any protocol that has the right build_header support.

AX25	
	This is an ALPHA release. It will not be a standard part
	of the real release module. Please read the copyrights on
	the AX.25 code carefully. When AX.25 is finished it will
	be part of a seperatly available amateur radio add on. Also
	please rememeber this is ALPHA code. It works well for a lot
	of people but I know for a fact it is currently buggy.

IPX
	The IPX module in here is fairly complete, and certainly
	usable for things. The IPX user code isn't yet very useful
	(nobody has written a RIP/SAP daemon!).

NetROM
	I'm slowly doing bits of this code, but its not even fit
	to include here.


Status:

Done:
	Replaced ARP with Florian la Roche's ARP.
	Replaced/improved sk_buff handlers (again from Florian)
	Removed surplus DDI code.
	Reformatted most modules.
	Fixed ICMP handling bugs (ICMP error to ICMP error).
	Fixed fragmentation bugs (both memory and mtu).
	Moved some includes.
	Drivers now build correctly with no IP layer.
	Merged Linus 1.0.1 diffs and my patches 1-3.
	Further fixups on clean driver build.
	Loopback driver now lives where it belongs.
	UDP verified against specification (passes).
	IP verified against specification (two errors: Incorrect forwarding and
		no mandatory option handling).
	ARP verified against specification (passes: recommendation that ARP
		rejects MAC broadcast/multicast addresses - this needs
		driver changes doing).
	All surplus skb->sk assignment and skb->mem_len skb->mem_addr removed.
	eth.h became linux/etherdevice.h.
	alloc_skb nows adds the sizeof(struct sk_buff) itself.
	Now relative to Linux 1.0.4.
	All IP wakeups are now callbacks.
	IPX and AX.25 callbacks now use wake_up_interruptible correctly.
	ICMP,IP and UDP collect snmp statistics.
	Removed the 4K limit from the /proc/net/* files.
	Routing bugs.
	Cleaned up skb duplication.
	IPX /proc from Mark Evans.
	Driver packet ordering now enforced.
	AX.25 unused SSID bits now set.

In Progress:
	Module by module validation against specifications.
	TCP delayed ACK	 [RFC1122 requires this].
	Byte-order fixes.
	Core code restructure to enable a working non IP build
	Trying to fix /proc to do >4K correctly, as well as dynamic addition
 		of /proc/ and /proc/net/ objects (for module protocol layers).
	Adding the extra NET2E driver ioctl() support.
	SNMP MIB statistic capture - finish TCP and add device layer when 
		Donald is ready.
	Donald Beckers latest driver mods.
	Adding the ICMP_TIMESTAMP support patch.
	Routing bugs.
	Packet level time stamping.
	Merging in support for the I^2IT 'TICK' time synchronisation chip.
	Crynwyr compliant PLIP driver.

To Do:
	Merge in sk_buff data handling module.
	Socket family/protocol seperation.
	Additional BSD options (SO_LOWAT etc).
	IP option handling, especially on ip forwards.
	AX.25 /proc support.
	SNMP /proc support.
	TCP MSS/Window and route metrics in the routing table.
	TCP mtu discovery support.
	NetROM.
	TCP closing side state machine bug fixes.
	NetBEUI (Lan Manager) [ie IEE802.3/IEE802.2/NetBIOS].
	Make drivers record type and addressing category(Multicast/Broadcast..)
	Speed it up.
	Unix domain cleanup/rewrite.
