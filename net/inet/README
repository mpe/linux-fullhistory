Upgrade Notes from 1.0
[Alan Cox -  Alan.Cox@linux.org]

Upgrading to 1.2.0 from a 1.0 kernel networking set. If you are using
a complete 1.2 distribution you can ignore this.

This doesn't attempt to list the changes. That would be too large. Instead
just what you need and can change

arp,ifconfig, etc. Get net-tools-1.1.95 (or 1.2.0 if its out) from
ftp.linux.org.uk:/pub/Linux/Networking/PROGRAMS/NetTools, and install
these. You will also acquire a couple of new tools "plipconfig" for tuning
plip links and "ipfw" for ip firewall management.

bootpd: The original bootpd has a bug that the 1.2 kernel spots. You will
need to upgrade this to the version in
ftp.linux.org.uk:/pub/Linux/Networking/PROGRAMS/Upgrades


Standard programs that you ought to update are

named 4.7.x	to 4.9.x	Stops named dying occasionally
pop3d 1.001     to 1.004	Fixes a bug that can lose mail

A complete current networking set for Linux can be obtained by getting
the NetKit[A,B...] series archives from ftp.funet.fi. Funet also carries
binaries for Linux mbone applications if you now wish to make use of
these facilities.

Please don't send commercial queries to my email address as I have that

free to send bug reports, queries and enhancements that way.
