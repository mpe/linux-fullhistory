------------------------

Major Changes

o	PLIP driver sort of works
o	UDP and RAW have been partially rewritten for speed
o	Internals heavily cleaned up, and memory monitoring of network
	memory is now done. (On shift-scroll-lock)
o	ARP should now not generate garbage
o	Using MSG_PEEK can't cause race conditions and crashes
o	Support for bootp clients.
o	Supports RFC931 TAP authd
o	NFS problems with certain types of network configuration are
	fixed.
o	Doesn't forward packets for other subnet (can cause packet storms)
o	TCP won't ack rst frames causing packet storms (especially with
	Lan workplace for DOS).
o	Numerous fixes for solidity
o	Verify_area used properly.
o	MSG_PEEK is faster again
o	Minor TCP fixes. Hopefully no more TCP lockups (ha!)
o	Donald's promiscuous mode. Go forth and write protocol analysers...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:
	Drivers for this stack set must be using alloc_skb() not just
kmalloc. If you get millions of 'non sk_buff...' errors please check the
driver you are using. All Donald's drivers know about this. If you have
a problem driver replace all cases of
	
	.. =(struct sk_buff *)kmalloc(sizeof(struct sk_buff)+...

With
	..=alloc_skb(sizeof(struct sk_buff)+...

And if it uses kfree_s on the packet change that to use kfree_skbmem().

Bug fixes and improvements for this section of the code should be mailed to
