These drivers support all common 8390-based ethernet boards.  Currently
"common" is defined as:

	3Com Products:
*	3Com 3c503	Board loaned by Chance Reschke, USRA.edu (thanks!)
	3Com 3c503/16	and excellent documentation provided by 3Com.

	Clones-n-things
	NE1000		Novell and Eagle are useless for documentation,
*	NE2000		but copied the designs directly from NatSemi;->.

	WD/SMC products
	WD8003
*	WD8013		Board loaned by Russ Nelson, Crynwr Software.  Thanks!

* I've seen it work myself!

There is support for the following boards, but since I've only been
able to borrow a thinnet of an HP ethercard I've relied upon reports
from others:

	HP LAN adaptors
**	HP27245
**	HP27247
**	HP27250

Thanks are due to the dozens of alpha testers.  Special thanks are due
to Chance Reschke <@usra.edu> and Russ Nelson <@crynwr.com> for
loaning me ethercards.

The following addresses are autoprobed, in this order:
wd.c:	0x300, 0x280, 0x380, 0x240
3c503:	0x300, 0x310, 0x330, 0x350, 0x250, 0x280, 0x2a0, 0x2e0
ne.c:	0x300, 0x280, 0x320, 0x340, 0x360
hp.c:	0x300, 0x320, 0x340, 0x280, 0x2C0, 0x200, 0x240

80x3 clones that are reported to work:
	LANNET LEC-45

"NE2000" clones that are reported to work:
	Alta Combo(NE2000 clone)
	Aritsoft LANtastic AE-2 (NE2000 clone w/ extra memory)
	Asante Etherpak 2001/2003
	D-Link Ethernet II
	LTC E-NET/16 P/N: 8300-200-002 (lipka@lip.hanse.de)
	Network Solutions HE-203
	SVEC 4 Dimension Ethernet
	4-Dimension FD0490 EtherBoard16
    	Cabletron products:
	 E1010		No ID PROM and sketchy info from Ctron means you'll
	 E1010-x 	have to compile-in information about your board.
	 E2010
	 E2010-x
		N.B. The E2100 will not work with Linux until Cabletron
		releases the programming information!

Important defines

For Space.c
#define EI8390 0		/* The base address of your ethercard.	*/
#define EI8390_IRQ 0		/* and the interrupt you want to use.	*/
				/* '0' means autoconfigure		*/
For 8390.c
#define EI_DEBUG 2		/* Use '0' for no messages.		*/
#define EL2			/* For the 3c503 driver.		*/
#define NE2000			/* For the NE1000/NE2000/Ctron driver.	*/
#define WD80x3			/* For the WD8003/WD8013 driver.	*/
#define HPLAN			/* For the HP27xxx driver.		*/

For the individual drivers

EI8390	Define (probably in autoconf.h or config.site.h) this to the base
	address	of your ethernet card.
EI8390_IRQ Define (probably in autoconf.h or config.site.h) this to the
	IRQ line of your ethernet card.  Most drivers convert a IRQ2 to an
	IRQ9 for you, so don't be surprised.
EI_DEBUG   Set to the desired numeric debugging level.  Use 3 or
	greater when actively debugging a problem, '1' for a
	casual interest in what's going on, and '0' for normal
	use. 
NO_PINGPONG
	Define this if you don't want ping-pong transmit buffers.
EL2_AUI
	Define for this if you are using the 3c503 and use the AUI/DIX
	connector rather than the built-in thin-net transceiver.
WD_SHMEM
	Define this to override the shared memory address used by the
	WD driver.  This should only be necessary for jumpered ethercards.

If you have a Cabletron ethercard you might want to look at ne.c:neprobe()
for info on how to enable more packet buffer space.

ETHERLINK1_IRQ
ETHERLINK1 Define these to the base address and IRQ of a 3c501 (NOT 3c503)
	card. Refer to net/tcp/Space.c.
