af_ax25.c:ax25_connect:

	There is a race with changing the socket state here which should be
	fixed by introduction of proper socket locking:

        if (sk->state != TCP_ESTABLISHED) {
                /* Not in ABM, not in WAIT_UA -> failed */
                sock->state = SS_UNCONNECTED;
                return sock_error(sk);  /* Always set at this point */
        }

Do the spinlocks ax25_list_lock, ax25_uid_lock and ax25_route_lock really
have to be interrupt safe?
