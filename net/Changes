Possible projects for victim^H^H^H^H^Holunteers


1.	Verifying the correctness of implementation against RFC1122 and
making a list of violations (BSD is sufficiently screwed up you can't
implement all of RFC1122 and talk to it usefully).

2.	Verifying all the error returns match the BSD ones (grotty job I
wouldn't wish on anyone).

3.	'Fast Retransmit'. This is a TCP algorithm extension BSD uses. If
you see about 3 acks in a row that are for the same 'old' value. You resend
the frame following the ack. (The assumption being that the acks are
because a single frame in the data stream has been lost). Given a 
mathematician with some queue theory you can show this allows you to 
lose one frame per window full of data without measurable speed loss.

4.	RFC1323 and RFC1191. These are the extensions for very fast nets
and for 'path MTU discovery' - a way of finding the best packetsize to use.
RFC1323 will be useful for Linux talking to systems over 100Mb/sec
ethernet and over ATM as it allows large windows and protects from some
potential high speed TCP problems.

5.	Fixing the IP fragment handling so that the total space allocated to
fragments is limited and old fragments are deleted to make room for new ones
when space is exhausted. Fixing the fragment handling to work at a decent
speed wouldn't be bad either.

6.	Delayed ack. This is mostly supported but not actually set up and
used yet. Basically ack frames are held back 1/10th of a second in the hope
that two acks can be merged into one or for interactive use the ack can
piggyback on the next character typed (great improvement on 2400 baud
modems). Johannes Stille did some work on this about 0.99.13 but it never
got merged in.

7.	One on my tempting project list. Add an extra (unofficial - but so
is SLIP6) SLIP mode that does packet data compression [maybe use the code
from term].

8.	Making SLIP/PPP dynamically allocate devices so you never run out
of channels.	[Taken/Done pending inclusion]

9.	Implementing streams. Not as a blind slow SYS5.4 style copy but actually
working out how to do it so it runs like greased lightning. Quite a big
problem.

10.	Frame Relay/WAN/ISDN drivers [I'm working on the sonix EuroISDN board
driver but thats for an internal project and its general release is still
a maybe (so is finishing it ;))].

11.	IP over SCSI.

12.	Debugging and making the appletalk alpha test code useful.
	[Done and in]

13.	Mrouted Multicast routing. Or possibly MOSPF and others
	as they become available
	[Some interest: see/join linux-multicast@www.linux.org.uk
         if you wish to join in]

14.	Bidirectional PLIP. Also PLIP for the newer style parallel ports.

15.	802.2LLC and thus Netbeui sockets. Becoming less important since the
rumour is microsoft are phasing out netbeui for netbios/IP.

16.	X.25. This is one for a real head case with far too much time on 
their hands. [Provisionally taken]

17.	PPP multilink. Another nasty job.

18.	Implement swIPe under Linux.
[In progress]

BTW: Don't let the magic words 'kernel programming' worry you. Its like DOS
- you make a mistake you have to reboot. You do at least get dumps and a
kernel logger that is reliable. There is now a loadable module allowing
use of gdb on the kernel (no breakpoints though!). No magic involved.
