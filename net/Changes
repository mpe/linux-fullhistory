Possible projects for victim^H^H^H^H^Holunteers


2.	Verifying all the error returns match the BSD ones (grotty job I
wouldn't wish on anyone).

3.	'Fast Retransmit'. This is a TCP algorithm extension BSD uses. If
you see about 3 acks in a row that are for the same 'old' value. You resend
the frame following the ack. (The assumption being that the acks are
because a single frame in the data stream has been lost). Given a 
mathematician with some queue theory you can show this allows you to 
lose one frame per window full of data without measurable speed loss.

4.	RFC1323. These are the extensions for very fast nets.
RFC1323 will be useful for Linux talking to systems over 100Mb/sec
ethernet and over ATM as it allows large windows and protects from some
potential high speed TCP problems.

6.	Delayed ack. This is mostly supported but not actually set up and
used yet. Basically ack frames are held back 1/10th of a second in the hope
that two acks can be merged into one or for interactive use the ack can
piggyback on the next character typed (great improvement on 2400 baud
modems). Johannes Stille did some work on this about 0.99.13 but it never
got merged in. [Pedro Roque]

7.	One on my tempting project list. Add an extra (unofficial - but so
is SLIP6) SLIP mode that does packet data compression [maybe use the code
from term].

9.	Implementing streams. Not as a blind slow SYS5.4 style copy but actually
working out how to do it so it runs like greased lightning. Quite a big
problem. [See the LiS project]

10.	Frame Relay/WAN/ISDN drivers [I'm working on the sonix EuroISDN board
driver but that's for an internal project and its general release is still
a maybe (so is finishing it ;))][Jim Freeman is working on Frame Relay as is
Mike McLagan][Fritz Elfert is doing the isdn4linux kit].
 
11.	IP over SCSI.

14.	Bidirectional PLIP. Also PLIP for the newer style parallel ports.

15.	802.2LLC and thus Netbeui sockets. Becoming less important since the
rumour is microsoft are phasing out netbeui for netbios/IP. Microsoft have
gone for netbios/funny-ipx-variant it seems in Win95, but TCP is selectable.

16.	X.25. This is one for a real head case with far too much time on 
their hands. [Provisionally taken]

17.	PPP multilink. Another nasty job.
[In progress]

18.	Implement swIPe under Linux.
[Reportedly in progress]

19.	IPv4 IP-AH and IP-ESP.
[Taken]

20.	SKIP IP security using ENskip-0.10 - started
[Abandoned]

21.	T/TCP support.

BTW: Don't let the magic words 'kernel programming' worry you. Its like DOS
- you make a mistake you have to reboot. You do at least get dumps and a
kernel logger that is reliable. There is now a loadable module allowing
use of gdb on the kernel (no breakpoints though!). No magic involved.
