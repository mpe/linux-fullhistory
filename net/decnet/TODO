Steve's quick list of things that need finishing off:
[they are in no particular order and range from the trivial to the long winded]

 o Proper timeouts on each neighbour (in routing mode) rather than
   just the 60 second On-Ethernet cache value.

 o Support for X.25 linklayer

 o Support for DDCMP link layer

 o The DDCMP device itself

 o PPP support (rfc1762)

 o Lots of testing with real applications

 o Verify errors etc. against POSIX 1003.1g (draft)

 o Using send/recvmsg() to get at connect/disconnect data (POSIX 1003.1g) 
   [maybe this should be done at socket level... the control data in the
    send/recvmsg() calls should simply be a vector of set/getsockopt()
    calls]

 o check MSG_TRUNC, MSG_CTRUNC are set where they should be.

 o Start to hack together user level software and add more DECnet support
   in ifconfig for example. 

 o Fix conninit_rx to check out each CI before queuing it. Support code is
   now in place, so this should be easy.

 o Work out which errors we can return from conninit_rx. Support code is
   now in place, so this should be easy.

 o Check out receiving of errors in the light of what conninit_rx can return

 o Test adding/deleting of routes

 o Test route lookup

 o Test /proc/net/decnet_route route listing works correctly (maybe I'll
   change the format of this file... atm its very similar to the IPv4 route
   file)

 o Find all the commonality between DECnet and IPv4 routing code and extract 
   it into a small library of routines. [probably a project for 2.5.xx]

 o Test ip_gre tunneling works... it did the last time I tested it and it
   will have to if I'm to test routing properly.

 o Hello messages should be generated for each primary address on each
   interface.

 o Add more information into /proc/net/decnet and finalise the format to
   allow DECnet support in netstat.

 o Make sure that returned connect messages are generated when they should
   be, and that the correct error messages are sent too. Ensure that the
   conninit receiving routine does not accept conninits with parameters
   that we cannot handle.
