Steve's quick list of things that need finishing off:
[they are in no particular order and range from the trivial to the long winded]

 o Proper timeouts on each neighbour (in routing mode) rather than
   just the 60 second On-Ethernet cache value.

 o MOP support (probably as part of Raw sockets) [hooks in]

 o Routing stuff in dn_fib.c

 o Misc. get/set_sockopt() functions [done for the time being, more later]

 o Support for X.25 linklayer

 o Support for DDCMP link layer

 o The DDCMP device itself

 o PPP support (rfc1762)

 o sendmsg() in the raw socket layer

 o Better filtering of traffic in raw sockets

 o Fix /proc for raw sockets

 o Lots of testing with real applications

 o Verify errors etc. against POSIX 1003.1g (draft)

 o Using send/recvmsg() to get at connect/disconnect data (POSIX 1003.1g) 
   [maybe this should be done at socket level... the control data in the
    send/recvmsg() calls should simply be a vector of set/getsockopt()
    calls]

 o recvmsg() to optionally report remote address.

 o check MSG_TRUNC, MSG_CTRUNC are set where they should be.

 o Work out if I really need support for rtnetlink "link" messages and if
   so how they should be handled.

 o More rtnetlink "route" message support & testing of this code

 o Routing ioctl() support

 o Start to hack together user level software and add more DECnet support
   in ifconfig for example. Also a DECnet equivalent to Alexey's ip config
   tool is required. Hopefully I can steal some code from that.

 o Sort out MSG_EOR in sendmsg.... should it be used, or is each transmission
   a seperate message ? What about when you get interrupted by a signal ?

 o Fix conninit_rx to check out each CI before queuing it

 o Work out which errors we can return from conninit_rx, and how to do it

 o Check out receiving of errors in the light of what conninit_rx can return
