                       Linux DECnet Project
                      ======================

For information on the Linux DECnet Project and the latest progress,
look at the project home page:

To contribute either mail <SteveW@ACM.org> or post on one of the Linux
mailing lists (either linux-net or netdev). DECnet for Linux will not
be distributed as part of the 2.2.xx kernel series. It is available as a
patch from the above site. Expect DECnet to arrive as part of the standard 
kernel distribution early in the 2.3.xx series.
