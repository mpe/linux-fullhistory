 *
 *	Some of the function names and the icmp unreach table for this
 *	module were derived from [icmp.c 1.0.11 06/02/93] by
 *	Ross Biro, Fred N. van Kempen, Mark Evans, Alan Cox, Gerhard Koerting.
 *	Other than that this module is a complete rewrite.
 *
 *	Fixes:
 *		Mike Shaver	:	RFC1122 checks.
 *		Alan Cox	:	Multicast ping reply as self.
 *		Alan Cox	:	Fix atomicity lockup in ip_build_xmit call
 *		Alan Cox	:	Added 216,128 byte paths to the MTU code.
 *		Martin Mares	:	RFC1812 checks.
 *		Martin Mares	:	Can be configured to follow redirects if acting
 *					as a router _without_ a routing protocol (RFC 1812).
 *		Martin Mares	:	Echo requests may be configured to be ignored (RFC 1812).
 *		Martin Mares	:	Limitation of ICMP error message transmit rate (RFC 1812).
 *		Martin Mares	:	TOS and Precedence set correctly (RFC 1812).
