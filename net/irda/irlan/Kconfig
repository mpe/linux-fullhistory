	  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrLAN protocol.  If
	  you want to compile it as a module (irlan), say M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  IrLAN emulates an Ethernet and
	  makes it possible to put up a wireless LAN using infrared beams.

	  The IrLAN protocol can be used to talk with infrared access points
	  like the HP NetbeamIR, or the ESI JetEye NET.  You can also connect
	  to another Linux machine running the IrLAN protocol for ad-hoc
	  networking!
