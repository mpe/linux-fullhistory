NetBEUI is a rather weird protocol. There are about three different set
of connection and name spaces here.

Firstly we have an array of 802.2 LLC links acting as reliable inter node
links for the nodes we are talking to do. We create and tear these down as
needed. In effect it goes around pretending ethernet is a set of bits of
wire and running pseudo X.25 over it. The LLC code is elsewhere (net/802).

Secondly we have the netbios name space. When we sit on multiple networks
we have fun. Netbios isnt routable, so we have to arse around looking on
all our devices for names.

Thirdly we have logical netbeui sessions on top of the whole heap. 

			*Don't blame us*

We didn't design the protocol.
