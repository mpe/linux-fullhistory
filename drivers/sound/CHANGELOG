Changelog for version 2.2b
-------------------------

Since 2.2
- Minor polishing.
- Interpreting of boot time arguments (sound=) for Linux.

Since 2.1
- Preliminary support for SB16. 
  - The SB16 mixer is supported in it's native mode.
  - Digitized voice capability up to 44.1 kHz/8 bit/mono
    (16 bit and stereo support coming in the next release).
- Fixed some bugs in the digitized voice driver for PAS16.
- Proper initialization of the SB emulation of latest PAS16 models.

- Significantly improved /dev/dsp and /dev/audio support.
  - Now supports half duplex mode. It's now possible to record and
    playback without closing and reopening the device.
  - It's possible to use smaller buffers than earlier. There is a new
    ioctl(fd, SNDCTL_DSP_SUBDIVIDE, &n) where n should be 1, 2 or 4.
    This call instructs the driver to use smaller buffers. The default
    buffer size (0.5 to 1.0 seconds) is divided by n. Should be called
    immediately after opening the device.

Since 2.0
Just cosmetic changes.
