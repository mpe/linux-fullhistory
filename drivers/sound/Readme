VoxWare v2.90 release notes
--------------------------


		This version includes some hidden features which
		are described in the file experimental.txt
		Some of these features are not enabled by default. Look at
		experimental.txt for more info.

		I just decided to release this version with some
		incompletely implemented features disabled since
		there are some new features required by a popular 
		application. In addition there is also support
		for the GUS MAX and the 16 bit sampling option of GUS.

		The MSS/WSS support works now. At least with SG NX Pro 16.

********* IMPORTANT *****************************************
Linux 1.0 or later is required to by this driver version.

Don't distribute binaries which use /dev/sequencer and are
compiled with the soundcard.h of this version. They will
not work with version 2.x of the driver.
*************************************************************


You will need the snd-util-2.5.tar.gz and snd-data-0.1.tar.Z
packages to use this driver. They should be in the same
ftp site or BBS from where you got this driver. For
example at nic.funet.fi:pub/OS/Linux/*.

If you are looking for the installation instructions, please
look at linux/Readme.

Compatibility with the earlier versions
---------------------------------------

This version is backward compatible with the version 2.X. All programs
compiled with sys/soundcard.h of v2.X should work without problems.
PROGRAMS COMPILED WITH THE sys/soundcard.h OF THIS VERSION WILL NOT
WORK WITH v2.X DRIVER. BE CAREFUL WHEN DISTRIBUTING BINARIES COMPILED 
FOR THIS VERSION.
