VoxWare v3.0.1 release notes
----------------------------

This version is the final v3.0. All features I have planned to
include in v3.0 are there but some of them are completely untested
(see experimental.txt).

*** GUS MAX enhancements *****************************************************
Recording with GUS MAX works now. The configuration program asks
two DMA channels for GUS MAX. You have to use two different 16 bit
DMA numbers (5, 6 or 7) if you want to record (8 bit DMA channels
may or may not work). It's still possible to use just one DMA channel
with GUS MAX but recording doesn't work in this case (a hardware limitation).
Even the driver has capability to use two DMA channels, simultaneous recording
and playback is not possible with GUS MAX (will not be before v4.0 
of the driver). However it's now possible to play using /dev/dsp and /dev/dsp1
at the same time (or /dev/dsp and /dev/sequencer as well).
Recording using /dev/dsp1 will not work if GUS MAX is configured to use two
DMA channels.
******************************************************************************

There are some additional device files (since v2.90-2 andv3.0-proto-94mmdd 
versions).
You will need to create additional device files using the script at the
end of ./linux/Readme. Also recompile all mixer programs since there are
some new channels that are not enabled in mixers compiled with older
soundcard.h.

There are some programming information (little bit old) in the
Hacker's Guide 
(ftp://nic.funet.fi/pub/OS/Linux/ALPHA/sound/snd-sdk-doc-0.1.ps.gz).
Believe me: The file is really there. The directory is just hidden and
you have to cd into it before the file is visible.

I have got many patches from various persons during last year. Some of
them are still on my mailbox and they should be included in versions
after v3.0 (I will not add aditional features before v3.0 is ready).

   ====================================================
-  THIS VERSION ____REQUIRES____ Linux 1.2.0 OR LATER.
   ====================================================

-  THIS VERSION MAY NOT WORK WITH Linux VERSIONS RELEASED
   AFTER end of July 1995. If this version doesn't compile with
   your kernel version, please use the sound driver version
   included in your kernel.
-  Ensoniq SoundScape support is included in this version but it's
   somehow incomplete. MIDI recording may not work and you have to
   use /dev/dsp1 and /dev/audio1 (/dev/dsp and /dev/audio don't work).
   I recommend you recreate the device files used by the driver by
   running the script at the end of linux/Readme. Then just
   rm /dev/dsp;ln -s /dev/dsp1 /dev/dsp (and the same with /dev/audio).
   You will also need the latest version of the soundscape.co[01] file.
   The old sndscape.cod will ___NOT___ work (it propably just hangs your
   system completely). The latest code file is available from ftp.ensoniq.com
   as part of the DOS/Windows driver distribution. See sndscape/ssinit.c
   for more info.
-  This is Linux only version. It should work in other operating systems
   (SCO, UW, FreeBSD and NetBSD) too but may require some fixes before
   it compiles.

You will need the snd-util-2.5.tar.gz and snd-data-0.1.tar.Z
packages to use this driver. They should be in the same
ftp site or BBS from where you got this driver. For
example at nic.funet.fi:pub/OS/Linux/*.

If you are looking for the installation instructions, please
look at linux/Readme.

Supported soundcards
--------------------

Gravis Ultrasound (GUS)
GUS MAX
GUS with the 16 bit sampling daughtercard
PAS16
Windows Sound System compatible soundcards
ECHO-PSS (cards based on the PSS architecture by Analog Devices.
	Including Orchid SW32, Cardinal DSP16 among others).
		(NOTE! WSS mode may not work (DMA channel setup problem)).
MediaTriX AudioTriX Pro (OPL4 and the optional effect daughtercard
	require special initialization. There is a program (setfx) in
	the audiotrix directory which does it).
Ensoniq SoundScape (works but needs some improvements)
MV Jazz16 based soundcards (ProSonic, 3D etc).
SoundMan Wave (recording may not work, mixer support is limited)
Mozart (OAK OTI-601 interface chip) based soundcards.
MAD16 (an interface chip by OPTi) based soundcards (TB Tropez ???).
(NOTE! The MAD16 looks similar to the Mozart chip. It could be a good
idea to configure MAD16 cards as Mozart ones. The MAD16 driver doesn't set
up MPU401 which the Mozart one does.

In addition all Sound Blaster models and clones (up to AWE32) work if
you want to use them.

The Emu synthesizer chip of AWE32 is not and will not be supported. The same is
true with the ASP chip also. Creative Technology will not release detailed
information about them so it's not possible to support them.

If you want to get support for AWE32 or ASP, please contact Creative Labs.
Ask _politely_ if they are going to support Linux. Maybe they change
their policy if there is enough demand.

===========================================================================
If your card is compatible with SB, MPU401 or Windows Sound System, it
may work with the driver even if it's not listed in the above list. In this
case it may require initialization using DOS. Just start DOS and cold
boot to Linux (etc.) by hitting ctrl-alt-del. 
===========================================================================

Compatibility with the earlier versions
---------------------------------------

There have been some changes in soundcard.h after v2.5 of the driver
(v2.90 is compatible with this one). Binaries compiled with this version
of soundcard.h will not work with v2.0 and earlier.

If you have some problems
=========================

Read the sound HOWTO (sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/...?).
Also look at the home page (http://personal.eunet.fi/pp/voxware). It may
contain info about some recent bug fixes.

It's likely that you have some problems when trying to use the sound driver
first time. Soundcards don't have standard configuration so there are no
good default configuration to use. Please try to use same I/O, DMA and IRQ
values for the soundcard than with DOS.

If you get an error message when trying to use the driver, please look
at /var/adm/messages for more verbose error message.


In general the easiest way to diagnoze problems is to do "cat /dev/sndstat".

If you get an error message, there are some problems with the driver setup:

	- "No such file or directory" tells that the device files for
	the sound driver are missing. Use the script at the end of
	linux/drivers/sound/Readme.linux to create them.

	- "No such device" telss that the sound driver is not in the kernel.
	You have to reconfigure and recompile the kernel to have the sound
	driver. Compiling the driver doesn't help alone. You have to boot
	with the newly compiled one before the driver becomes active.
	The Linux-HOWTO should help in this step.

The following errors are likely with /dev/dsp and /dev/audio.

	- "No such device or address". This error message should not happen
	with /dev/sndstat but it's possible with the other sound devices.
	This error indicates that there are no suitable hardware for the
	device file or the sound driver has been compiled without support for
	this particular device. For example /dev/audio and /dev/dsp will not
	work if "digitized voice support" was not enabled during "make config".
	
	- "Device or resource busy". Propably the IRQ (or DMA) channel 
	required by the soundcard is in use by some other device/driver.

	- "I/O error". Almost certainly (99%) it's an IRQ or DMA conflict.
	Look at the kernel messages in /var/adm/notice for more info.

	- "Invalid argument". The application is calling ioctl()
	with impossible parameters. Check that the application is
	for sound driver version 2.X or later.

In general the printout of of /dev/sndstat should tell what is the problem.
It's possible that there are bugs in the sound driver but 99% of the problems
reported to me are caused by somehow incorrect setup during "make config".

For owners of TI TM4000M notebooks
----------------------------------

There appears to be some kind of conflict between the sound support
(MV Jazz), mouse port and VoxWare. You could try to configure kernel
with the C&T 82C710 mouse port support disabled.
