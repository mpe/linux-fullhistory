OSS/Free version 3.8 release notes
----------------------------------

Most up to date information about this driver is available from 
http://www.opensound.com/ossfree.



Please read the SOUND-HOWTO (available from sunsite.unc.edu and other Linux FTP 
sites). It gives instructions about using sound with Linux. It's bit out of
date but still very useful. Information about bug fixes and such things
is available from the web page (see above).

Please check http://www.opensound.com/pguide for more info about programming
with OSS API.

   ====================================================
-  THIS VERSION ____REQUIRES____ Linux 2.1.57 OR LATER.
   ====================================================

Packages "snd-util-3.8.tar.gz" and "snd-data-0.1.tar.Z"
contain useful utilities to be used with this driver.
See http://www.opensound.com/ossfree/getting.html for
download instructions.

If you are looking for the installation instructions, please
look at Readme.linux.

Supported sound cards
---------------------

See Readme.cards.

Please check http://www.opensound.com/ossfree if you don't find
your sound card there.

There are probably many other names missing. If you have sent me some
patches and your name is not in the above list, please inform me.

Sending your contributions or patches
-------------------------------------

First of all it's highly recommended to contact me before sending anything
or before even starting to do any work. Tell me what you suggest to be
changed or what you have planned to do. Also ensure you are using the
very latest (development) version of OSS/Free since the change may already be
implemented there. In general it's major waste of time to try to improve
several months old version. Information about the latest version can be found
from http://www.opensound.com/ossfree. In general there is no point in
sending me patches relative to production kernels.

If you have some problems
=========================

Read the sound HOWTO (sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/...?).
Also look at the home page (http://www.opensound.com/ossfree). It may
contain info about some recent bug fixes.

It's likely that you have some problems when trying to use the sound driver
first time. Sound cards don't have standard configuration so there are no
good default configuration to use. Please try to use same I/O, DMA and IRQ
values for the sound card than with DOS.

If you get an error message when trying to use the driver, please look
at /var/adm/messages for more verbose error message.


In general the easiest way to diagnose problems is to do "cat /dev/sndstat".

If you get an error message, there are some problems with the driver setup:

	- "No such file or directory" tells that the device files for
	the sound driver are missing. Use the script at the end of
	linux/drivers/sound/Readme.linux to create them.

	- "No such device" tells that the sound driver is not in the kernel.
	You have to reconfigure and recompile the kernel to have the sound
	driver. Compiling the driver doesn't help alone. You have to boot
	with the newly compiled one before the driver becomes active.
	The Linux-HOWTO should help in this step.

The following errors are likely with /dev/dsp and /dev/audio.

	- "No such device or address". This error message should not happen
	with /dev/sndstat but it's possible with the other sound devices.
	This error indicates that there are no suitable hardware for the
	device file or the sound driver has been compiled without support for
	this particular device. For example /dev/audio and /dev/dsp will not
	work if "digitized voice support" was not enabled during "make config".
	
	- "Device or resource busy". Probably the IRQ (or DMA) channel 
	required by the sound card is in use by some other device/driver.

	- "I/O error". Almost certainly (99%) it's an IRQ or DMA conflict.
	Look at the kernel messages in /var/adm/notice for more info.

	- "Invalid argument". The application is calling ioctl()
	with impossible parameters. Check that the application is
	for sound driver version 2.X or later.

In general the printout of /dev/sndstat should tell what is the problem.
It's possible that there are bugs in the sound driver but 99% of the problems
reported to me are caused by somehow incorrect setup during "make config".
