   READ THIS

   This module is intended for Audio Excel DSP 16 Sound Card.

   Audio Excel DSP 16 is an SB pro II, Microsoft Sound System
   and MPU-401 compatible card.
   It is software-only configurable (no jumpers to hard-set irq/dma/mpu-irq),
   so before this module, the only way to configure the DSP under linux was
   boot the MS-BAU loading the sound.sys device driver (this driver soft-
   configure the sound board hardware by massaging someone of its registers),
   and then ctrl-alt-del to boot linux with the DSP configured by the DOG
   driver.

   This module works configuring your Audio Excel DSP 16's
   irq, dma and mpu-401-irq. The voxware probe routines rely on the
   fact that if the hardware is there, they can detect it. The problem
   with AEDSP16 is that no hardware can be found by the probe routines
   if the sound card is not well configured. Sometimes the kernel probe
   routines can find an SBPRO even when the card is not configured (this
   is the standard setup of the card), but the SBPRO emulation don't work
   well if the card is not properly initialized. For this reason

   InitAEDSP16_...()

   routines are called before the voxware probe routines try to detect the
   hardware.

   NOTE (READ THE NOTE TOO, IT CONTAIN USEFUL INFORMATIONS)

   The Audio Excel DSP 16 Sound Card emulates both SBPRO and MSS;
   the voxware sound driver can be configured for SBPRO and MSS cards
   at the same time, but the aedsp16 can't be two cards!!
   When we configure it, we have to choose the SBPRO or the MSS emulation
   for AEDSP16. We also can install a *REAL* card of the other type
   (see [1], not tested but I can't see any reason for it to fail).

   NOTE: If someone can test the combination AEDSP16+MSS or AEDSP16+SBPRO
   please let me know if it works.

   The MPU-401 support can be compiled in together with one of the other
   two operating modes.

   The board configuration calls, are in the probe_...() routines because
   we have to configure the board before probing it for a particular
   hardware. After card configuration, we can probe the hardware.

   NOTE: This is something like plug-and-play: we have only to plug
   the AEDSP16 board in the socket, and then configure and compile
   a kernel that uses the AEDSP16 software configuration capability.
   No jumper setting is needed!

   For example, if you want AEDSP16 to be an SBPro, on irq 10, dma 3
   you have just to make config the voxware package, configuring
   the SBPro sound card with that parameters, then when configure
   asks if you have an AEDSP16, answer yes. That's it.
   Compile the kernel and run it.

   NOTE: This means that you can choose irq and dma, but not the
   I/O addresses. To change I/O addresses you have to set them
   with jumpers.

   NOTE: InitAEDSP16_...() routines get as parameter the hw_config,
   the hardware configuration of the - to be configured - board.
   The InitAEDSP16() routine, configure the board following our
   wishes, that are in the hw_config structure.

   You can change the irq/dma/mirq settings WITHOUT THE NEED to open
   your computer and massage the jumpers (there are no irq/dma/mirq
   jumpers to be configured anyway, only I/O port ones have to be
   configured with jumpers)

   For some ununderstandable reason, the card default of irq 7, dma 1,
   don't work for me. Seems to be an IRQ or DMA conflict. Under heavy
   HDD work, the kernel start to erupt out a lot of messages like:

   'Sound: DMA timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?'

   For what I can say, I have NOT any conflict at irq 7 (under linux I'm
   using the lp polling driver), and dma line 1 is unused as stated by
   /proc/dma. I can suppose this is a bug of AEDSP16. I know my hardware so
   I'm pretty sure I have not any conflict, but may be I'm wrong. Who knows!
   Anyway a setting of irq 10, dma 3 works really fine.

   NOTE: if someone can use AEDSP16 with irq 7, dma 1, please let me know
   the emulation mode, all the installed hardware and the hardware
   configuration (irq and dma settings of all the hardware).

   This init module should work with SBPRO+MSS, when one of the two is
   the AEDSP16 emulation and the other the real card. (see [1])
   For example:

   AEDSP16 (0x220) in SBPRO emu (0x220) + real MSS + other
   AEDSP16 (0x220) in MSS emu + real SBPRO (0x240) + other

   MPU401 should work. (see [1])

   [1] Not tested by me for lack of hardware.

   TODO, WISHES AND TECH

   May be there's lot of redundant delays, but for now I want to leave it
   this way.

   Should be interesting eventually write down a new ioctl for the
   aedsp16, to let the suser() change the irq/dma/mirq on the fly.
   The thing is not trivial.
   In the real world, there's no need to have such an ioctl because
   when we configure the kernel for compile, we can choose the config
   parameters. If we change our mind, we can easily re-config the kernel
   and re-compile.
   Why let the suser() change the config parameters on the fly ?
   If anyone have a reasonable answer to this question, I will write down
   the code to do it.

   More integration with voxware, using voxware low level routines to
   read-write dsp is not possible because you may want to have MSS
   support and in that case we can not rely on the functions included
   in sb_dsp.c to control 0x2yy I/O ports. I will continue to use my
   own I/O functions.

   - About I/O ports allocation -

   The request_region should be done at device probe in every sound card
   module. This module is not the best site for requesting regions.
   When the request_region code will be added to the main modules such as
   sb, adlib, gus, ad1848, etc, the requesting code in this module should
   go away.

   I think the request regions should be done this way:

   if (check_region(...))
   return ERR; // I/O region already reserved
   device_probe(...);
   device_attach(...);
   request_region(...); // reserve only when we are sure all is okay

   Request the 2x0h region in any case if we are using this card.

   NOTE: the "(sbpro)" string with which we are requesting the aedsp16 region
   (see code) does not mean necessarily that we are emulating sbpro.
   It mean that the region is the sbpro I/O ports region. We use this
   region to access the control registers of the card, and if emulating
   sbpro, I/O sbpro registers too. If we are emulating MSS, the sbpro
   registers are not used, in no way, to emulate an sbpro: they are
   used only for configuration purposes.

   Someone pointed out that should be possible use both the SBPRO and MSS
   modes because the sound card have all the two chipsets, supposing that
   the card is really two cards. I have tried something to have the two
   modes work together, but, for some reason unknown to me, without success.

   I think all the soft-config only cards have an init sequence similar to
   this. If you have a card that is not an aedsp16, you can try to start
   with this module changing it (mainly in the CMD? I think) to fit your
   needs.

   Started Fri Mar 17 16:13:18 MET 1995

   v0.1 (ALPHA, was an user-level program called AudioExcelDSP16.c)
   - Initial code.
   v0.2 (ALPHA)
   - Cleanups.
   - Integrated with Linux voxware v 2.90-2 kernel sound driver.
   - SoundBlaster Pro mode configuration.
   - Microsoft Sound System mode configuration.
   - MPU-401 mode configuration.
   v0.3 (ALPHA)
   - Cleanups.
   - Rearranged the code to let InitAEDSP16 be more general.
   - Erased the REALLY_SLOW_IO. We don't need it. Erased the linux/io.h
   inclusion too. We rely on os.h
   - Used the  to get a variable
   len string (we are not sure about the len of Copyright string).
   This works with any SB and compatible.
   - Added the code to request_region at device init (should go in
   the main body of voxware).
   v0.4 (BETA)
   - Better configure.c patch for aedsp16 configuration (better
   logic of inclusion of AEDSP16 support)
   - Modified the conditional compilation to better support more than
   one sound card of the emulated type (read the NOTES above)
   - Moved the sb init routine from the attach to the very first
   probe in sb_card.c
   - Rearrangements and cleanups
   - Wiped out some unnecessary code and variables: this is kernel
   code so it is better save some TEXT and DATA
   - Fixed the request_region code. We must allocate the aedsp16 (sbpro)
   I/O ports in any case because they are used to access the DSP
   configuration registers and we can not allow anyone to get them.
   v0.5
   - cleanups on comments
   - prep for diffs against v3.0-proto-950402
   v0.6
   - removed the request_region()s when compiling the MODULE sound.o
   because we are not allowed (by the actual voxware structure) to
   release_region()
