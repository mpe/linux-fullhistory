# Sound driver configuration
#
#--------
# There is another config script which is compatible with rest of
# the kernel. It can be activated by running 'make mkscript' in this
# directory. Please note that this is an _experimental_ feature which
# doesn't work with all cards (PSS, SM Wave, AudioTriX Pro).

$MAKE -C drivers/sound config || exit 1
