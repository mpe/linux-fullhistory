NOTE!

	This is an ALPHA TEST VERSION (pre 3.0). The latest
	released version of this driver is now part of
	Linux kernel distribution. For other operating systems
	use the snd-driv-2.5.tar.gz package.

	This particular version contains lots of new features
	BUT THERE ARE NO APPLICATIONS WHICH USE THEM. So there
	is no need to install this version as long as you are
	not developing the driver or applications which use it.
	All new features are in the /dev/sequencer and /dev/midi
	parts of the driver.

	
	This version is little bit incomplete. Some features have
	not been implemented for each soundcards yet. All features
	of v2.4 should work OK.

CAUTION!
	This version of driver works with applications written and
	compiled for v2.*. The problem is that APPLICATIONS COMPILED
	WITH soundcard.h OF THIS VERSION WILL NOT WORK WITH OLDER DRIVER.
	Be careful when distributing applications compiled with this
	version (just the apps using /dev/sequencer are incompatible).

	*********************************************************
	* IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE SOUND DRIVER,	*
	* PLEASE READ THE SOUND-HOWTO. IT'S AVAILABLE FROM YOUR	*
	* NEAREST LINUX FTP SITE AND CONTAINS ANSWER TO YOUR	*
	* PROBLEM.						*
