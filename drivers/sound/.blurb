NOTE!	This driver version is not compatible with the version 1.0c.
	This means you have to use the latest version of the snd-util
	package. The earlier ones (from 1.0) will not work. If you have
	other programs using ioctl calls of the driver, they must be
	recompiled. Most of them will not work without some source
	modifications.
