/*
 * The AD1848 codec has generic input lines called Line, Aux1 and Aux2.
 * Soundcard manufacturers have connected actual inputs (CD, synth, line,
 * etc) to these inputs in different order. Therefore it's difficult
 * to assign mixer channels to to these inputs correctly. The following
 * contains two alternative mappings. The first one is for GUS MAX and
 * the second is just a generic one (line1, line2 and line3).
 * (Actually this is not a mapping but rather some kind of interleaving
 * solution).
