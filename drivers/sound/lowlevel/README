Additional low level sound drivers for Linux
============================================

This directory contains some low level sound drivers.
These drivers are used to be (when Linux sound drivers was OSS/Lite) external
drivers, not maintained by Hannu Savolainen and not touched by him.
Now things are changed: the new Linux sound driver code maintained by Alan Cox
include these lowlevel drivers and they are no more neglected (thanks Alan).

The following low level drivers are included:

- ACI MIXER for miroPCM12 by Markus Kuhn
  (mskuhn@cip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de).
- Audio Excel DSP 16 initialization driver by Riccardo Facchetti
  (fizban@tin.it)
- SB32/AWE synthesizer driver (Emu8000) by Takashi Iwai
  (iwai@dragon.mm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp).

You can find documentation for these drivers in the Documentation/sound
directory.
