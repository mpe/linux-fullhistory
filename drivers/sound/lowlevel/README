Additional low level sound drivers for Linux
============================================

This directory contains additional low level sound drivers which
are not part of USS/Lite (Open Sound System). These drivers are
maintained by their authors (not by Hannu Savolainen).

If you like to write a new low level sound driver, please contact
Hannu Savolainen (hannu@voxware.pp.fi) for more info.

The following low level drivers are included:

- ACI MIXER for miroPCM12 by Markus Kuhn
(mskuhn@cip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de).
- SB32/AWE synthesizer driver (Emu8000) by Takashi Iwai
(iwai@dragon.mm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp). See README.awe for more
info.
