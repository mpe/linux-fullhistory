	  Some VIA processors come with an integrated crypto engine
	  (so called VIA PadLock ACE, Advanced Cryptography Engine)
	  that provides instructions for very fast {en,de}cryption 
	  with some algorithms.
	  
	  The instructions are used only when the CPU supports them.
	  Otherwise software encryption is used. If you are unsure,
	  say Y.

config CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK_AES
	bool "Support for AES in VIA PadLock"
	depends on CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK
	default y
	help
	  Use VIA PadLock for AES algorithm.
