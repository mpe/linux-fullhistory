This hard disk driver (hd.c) includes support for IDE Multiple Mode
and IRQ-unmasking during I/O (both disabled by default), as well as
support for drives where the BIOS reports "more than 16 heads".

The hdparm.c program for controlling various features is now packaged
separately.  Look for it on your favorite linux FTP site.
