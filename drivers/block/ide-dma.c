/*
 * This module provides support for the bus-master IDE DMA functions
 * of various PCI chipsets, including the Intel PIIX (i82371FB for
 * the 430 FX chipset), the PIIX3 (i82371SB for the 430 HX/VX and 
 * 440 chipsets), and the PIIX4 (i82371AB for the 430 TX chipset)
 * ("PIIX" stands for "PCI ISA IDE Xcellerator").
 *
 * Pretty much the same code works for other IDE PCI bus-mastering chipsets.
 *
 * DMA is supported for all IDE devices (disk drives, cdroms, tapes, floppies).
 *
 * By default, DMA support is prepared for use, but is currently enabled only
 * for drives which already have DMA enabled (UltraDMA or mode 2 multi/single),
 * or which are recognized as "good" (see table below).  Drives with only mode0
 * or mode1 (multi/single) DMA should also work with this chipset/driver
 * (eg. MC2112A) but are not enabled by default.
 *
 * Use "hdparm -i" to view modes supported by a given drive.
 *
 * The hdparm-2.4 (or later) utility can be used for manually enabling/disabling
 * DMA support, but must be (re-)compiled against this kernel version or later.
 *
 * To enable DMA, use "hdparm -d1 /dev/hd?" on a per-drive basis after booting.
 * If problems arise, ide.c will disable DMA operation after a few retries.
 * This error recovery mechanism works and has been extremely well exercised.
 *
 * IDE drives, depending on their vintage, may support several different modes
 * of DMA operation.  The boot-time modes are indicated with a "*" in
 * the "hdparm -i" listing, and can be changed with *knowledgeable* use of
 * the "hdparm -X" feature.  There is seldom a need to do this, as drives
 * normally power-up with their "best" PIO/DMA modes enabled.
 *
 * Testing has been done with a rather extensive number of drives,
 * with Quantum & Western Digital models generally outperforming the pack,
 * and Fujitsu & Conner (and some Seagate which are really Conner) drives
 * showing more lackluster throughput.
 *
 * Keep an eye on /var/adm/messages for "DMA disabled" messages.
 *
 * Some people have reported trouble with Intel Zappa motherboards.
 * This can be fixed by upgrading the AMI BIOS to version 1.00.04.BS0,
 * available from ftp://ftp.intel.com/pub/bios/10004bs0.exe
 * (thanks to Glen Morrell <glen@spin.Stanford.edu> for researching this).
 *
 * Thanks to "Christopher J. Reimer" <reimer@doe.carleton.ca> for
 * fixing the problem with the BIOS on some Acer motherboards.
 *
 * Thanks to "Benoit Poulot-Cazajous" <poulot@chorus.fr> for testing
 * "TX" chipset compatibility and for providing patches for the "TX" chipset.
 *
 * Thanks to Christian Brunner <chb@muc.de> for taking a good first crack
 * at generic DMA -- his patches were referred to when preparing this code.
 *
 * Most importantly, thanks to Robert Bringman <rob@mars.trion.com>
 * for supplying a Promise UDMA board & WD UDMA drive for this work!
 *
 * And, yes, Intel Zappa boards really *do* use both PIIX IDE ports.
