 *    directly to them.  This can be achieved by providing a function
 *    to blk_queue_make_request().
 *
 * Caveat:
 *    The driver that does this *must* be able to deal appropriately

 *
 * Description:
 *    If a block device wishes to use the standard request handling procedures,
 *    which sorts requests and coalesces adjacent requests, then it must
 *    call blk_init_queue().  The function @rfn will be called when there
 *    are requests on the queue that need to be processed.  If the device
 *    supports plugging, then @rfn may not be called immediately when requests
 *    are available on the queue, but may be called at some time later instead.
 *    Plugged queues are generally unplugged when a buffer belonging to one
 *    of the requests on the queue is needed, or due to memory pressure.
 *
 *    @rfn is not required, or even expected, to remove all requests off the
 *    queue, but only as many as it can handle at a time.  If it does leave
 *    requests on the queue, it is responsible for arranging that the requests
 *    get dealt with eventually.
 *
 *    A global spin lock $io_request_lock must be held while manipulating the
 *    requests on the request queue.
 *
 *    The request on the head of the queue is by default assumed to be
 *    potentially active, and it is not considered for re-ordering or merging
 *    whenever the given queue is unplugged. This behaviour can be changed with
 *    blk_queue_headactive().
 *
 * Note:
 *    blk_init_queue() must be paired with a blk_cleanup_queue() call
 *    when the block device is deactivated (such as at module unload).

 * generic_make_request: hand a buffer head to it's device driver for I/O
 * @rw:  READ, WRITE, or READA - what sort of I/O is desired.
 * @bh:  The buffer head describing the location in memory and on the device.
 *
 * generic_make_request() is used to make I/O requests of block
 * devices. It is passed a &struct buffer_head and a &rw value.  The
 * %READ and %WRITE options are (hopefully) obvious in meaning.  The
 * %READA value means that a read is required, but that the driver is
 * free to fail the request if, for example, it cannot get needed
 * resources immediately.
 *
 * generic_make_request() does not return any status.  The
 * success/failure status of the request, along with notification of
 * completion, is delivered asynchronously through the bh->b_end_io
 * function described (one day) else where.
 *
 * The caller of generic_make_request must make sure that b_page,
 * b_addr, b_size are set to describe the memory buffer, that b_rdev
 * and b_rsector are set to describe the device address, and the
 * b_end_io and optionally b_private are set to describe how
 * completion notification should be signaled.  BH_Mapped should also
 * be set (to confirm that b_dev and b_blocknr are valid).
 *
 * generic_make_request and the drivers it calls may use b_reqnext,
 * and may change b_rdev and b_rsector.  So the values of these fields
 * should NOT be depended on after the call to generic_make_request.
 * Because of this, the caller should record the device address
 * information in b_dev and b_blocknr.
 *
 * Apart from those fields mentioned above, no other fields, and in
 * particular, no other flags, are changed by generic_make_request or
 * any lower level drivers.

 * appears to be clean when doing a write request, and any buffer that
 * appears to be up-to-date when doing read request.  Further it marks
 * as clean buffers that are processed for writing (the buffer cache
 * wont assume that they are actually clean until the buffer gets
 * unlocked).
 *
 * ll_rw_block sets b_end_io to simple completion handler that marks
 * the buffer up-to-date (if approriate), unlocks the buffer and wakes
 * any waiters.  As client that needs a more interesting completion
