This driver does not support XA or MultiSession CDs (PhotoCDs). Use the
experimental driver mcdx.c for that.

You can use mcd for one interface, and mcdx for another; this way, you
can use the audio functions with the "old" driver, and read XA CDs with
the "new" driver (if you have at least two drives).
