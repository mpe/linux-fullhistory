 * This routine is called from the partition-table code in pt/msdos.c.
 * It has two tasks:
 * (i) to handle Ontrack DiskManager by offsetting everything by 63 sectors,
 *  or to handle EZdrive by remapping sector 0 to sector 1.
 * (ii) to invent a translated geometry.
 * Part (i) is suppressed if the user specifies the "noremap" option
 * on the command line.
 * Part (ii) is suppressed if the user specifies an explicit geometry.
 *
 * The ptheads parameter is either 0 or tells about the number of
 * heads shown by the end of the first nonempty partition.
 * If this is either 16, 32, 64, 128, 240 or 255 we'll believe it.
 *
 * The xparm parameter has the following meaning:
 *	 0 = convert to CHS with fewer than 1024 cyls
 *	     using the same method as Ontrack DiskManager.
 *	 1 = same as "0", plus offset everything by 63 sectors.
 *	-1 = similar to "0", plus redirect sector 0 to sector 1.
 *	 2 = convert to a CHS geometry with "ptheads" heads.
 *
 * Returns 0 if the translation was not possible, if the device was not 
 * an IDE disk drive, or if a geometry was "forced" on the commandline.
 * Returns 1 if the geometry translation was successful.
