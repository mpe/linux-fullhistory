config HOTPLUG_PCI
	tristate "Support for PCI Hotplug (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have a motherboard with a PCI Hotplug controller.
	  This allows you to add and remove PCI cards while the machine is
	  powered up and running.  The file system pcihpfs must be mounted
	  in order to interact with any PCI Hotplug controllers.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called pci_hotplug. If you want to compile it
	  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  When in doubt, say N.

config HOTPLUG_PCI_FAKE
	tristate "Fake PCI Hotplug driver"
	depends on HOTPLUG_PCI
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use the fake PCI hotplug driver. It can
	  be used to simulate PCI hotplug events if even if your system is
	  not PCI hotplug capable.

	  This driver will "emulate" removing PCI devices from the system.
	  If the "power" file is written to with "0" then the specified PCI
	  device will be completely removed from the kernel.

	  WARNING, this does NOT turn off the power to the PCI device.
	  This is a "logical" removal, not a physical or electrical
	  removal.

	  Use this module at your own risk.  You have been warned!

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called fakephp. If you want to compile it
	  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  When in doubt, say N.

config HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ
	tristate "Compaq PCI Hotplug driver"
	depends on HOTPLUG_PCI && X86
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a motherboard with a Compaq PCI Hotplug
	  controller.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called cpqphp. If you want to compile it
	  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  When in doubt, say N.

config HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ_NVRAM
	bool "Save configuration into NVRAM on Compaq servers"
	depends on HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a Compaq server that has a PCI Hotplug
	  controller.  This will allow the PCI Hotplug driver to store the PCI
	  system configuration options in NVRAM.

	  When in doubt, say N.

config HOTPLUG_PCI_IBM
	tristate "IBM PCI Hotplug driver"
	depends on HOTPLUG_PCI && X86_IO_APIC && X86
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a motherboard with a IBM PCI Hotplug
	  controller.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called cpqphp. If you want to compile it
	  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  When in doubt, say N.

config HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI
	tristate "ACPI PCI Hotplug driver"
	depends on ACPI_BUS && HOTPLUG_PCI
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a system that supports PCI Hotplug using
	  ACPI.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called acpiphp. If you want to compile it
	  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  When in doubt, say N.

config HOTPLUG_PCI_CPCI
	tristate "CompactPCI Hotplug driver"
	depends on HOTPLUG_PCI
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a CompactPCI system card with CompactPCI
	  hotswap support per the PICMG 2.1 specification.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called cpci_hotplug. If you want to compile it
	  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  When in doubt, say N.

config HOTPLUG_PCI_CPCI_ZT5550
	tristate "Ziatech ZT5550 CompactPCI Hotplug driver"
	depends on HOTPLUG_PCI_CPCI && X86
	help
	  Say Y here if you have an Performance Technologies (formerly Intel,
          formerly just Ziatech) Ziatech ZT5550 CompactPCI system card.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called cpcihp_zt5550. If you want to compile it

config HOTPLUG_PCI_CPCI_GENERIC
	tristate "Generic port I/O CompactPCI Hotplug driver"
	depends on HOTPLUG_PCI_CPCI && X86
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a CompactPCI system card that exposes the #ENUM
	  hotswap signal as a bit in a system register that can be read through
	  standard port I/O.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called cpcihp_generic. If you want to compile it
