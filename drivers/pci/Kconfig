config PCI_LEGACY_PROC
	bool "Legacy /proc/pci interface"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  This feature enables a procfs file -- /proc/pci -- that provides a 
	  summary of PCI devices in the system. 

	  This feature has been deprecated as of v2.5.53, in favor of using the 
	  tool lspci(8). This feature may be removed at a future date. 

	  lspci can provide the same data, as well as much more. lspci is a part of
	  the pci-utils package, which should be installed by your distribution. 
	  See Documentation/Changes for information on where to get the latest 
	  version. 

	  When in doubt, say N.

config PCI_NAMES
	bool "PCI device name database"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  By default, the kernel contains a database of all known PCI device
	  names to make the information in /proc/pci, /proc/ioports and
	  similar files comprehensible to the user. 

	  This database increases size of the kernel image by about 80KB. This 
	  memory is freed after the system boots up if CONFIG_HOTPLUG is not set.

	  Anyway, if you are building an installation floppy or kernel for an 
	  embedded system where kernel image size really matters, you can disable 
	  this feature and you'll get device ID numbers instead of names.

	  When in doubt, say Y.
