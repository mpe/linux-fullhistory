	bool "PCI device name database"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  By default, the kernel contains a database of all known PCI device
	  names to make the information in /proc/pci, /proc/ioports and
	  similar files comprehensible to the user. This database increases
	  size of the kernel image by about 80KB, but it gets freed after the
	  system boots up, so it doesn't take up kernel memory. Anyway, if you
	  are building an installation floppy or kernel for an embedded system
	  where kernel image size really matters, you can disable this feature
	  and you'll get device ID numbers instead of names.

	  When in doubt, say Y.
