HCI UART driver
CONFIG_BT_HCIUART
  Bluetooth HCI UART driver.
  This driver is required if you want to use Bluetooth devices with
  serial port interface. You will also need this driver if you have 
  UART based Bluetooth PCMCIA and CF devices like Xircom Credit Card 
  adapter and BrainBoxes Bluetooth PC Card.

  Say Y here to compile support for Bluetooth UART devices into the
  kernel or say M to compile it as module (hci_uart.o).

HCI UART (H4) protocol support 
CONFIG_BT_HCIUART_H4
  UART (H4) is serial protocol for communication between Bluetooth 
  device and host. This protocol is required for most Bluetooth devices 
  with UART interface, including PCMCIA and CF cards. 

  Say Y here to compile support for HCI UART (H4) protocol.

HCI BCSP protocol support 
CONFIG_BT_HCIUART_BCSP
  BCSP (BlueCore Serial Protocol) is serial protocol for communication 
  between Bluetooth device and host. This protocol is required for non
  USB Bluetooth devices based on CSR BlueCore chip, including PCMCIA and 
  CF cards.

  Say Y here to compile support for HCI BCSP protocol.

HCI USB driver
CONFIG_BT_HCIUSB
  Bluetooth HCI USB driver.
  This driver is required if you want to use Bluetooth devices with
  USB interface.

  Say Y here to compile support for Bluetooth USB devices into the
  kernel or say M to compile it as module (hci_usb.o).

HCI USB zero packet support
CONFIG_BT_USB_ZERO_PACKET
  Support for USB zero packets. 
  This option is provided only as a work around for buggy Bluetooth USB 
  devices. Do _not_ enable it unless you know for sure that your device 
  requires zero packets.
  Most people should say N here.

HCI VHCI Virtual HCI device driver
CONFIG_BT_HCIVHCI
  Bluetooth Virtual HCI device driver.
  This driver is required if you want to use HCI Emulation software.

  Say Y here to compile support for virtual HCI devices into the
  kernel or say M to compile it as module (hci_vhci.o).

HCI DTL1 (PC Card) device driver
CONFIG_BT_HCIDTL1
  Bluetooth HCI DTL1 (PC Card) driver.
  This driver provides support for Bluetooth PCMCIA devices with
  Nokia DTL1 interface:
     Nokia Bluetooth Card
     Socket Bluetooth CF Card

  Say Y here to compile support for HCI DTL1 devices into the
  kernel or say M to compile it as module (dtl1_cs.o).

HCI BT3C (PC Card) device driver
CONFIG_BT_HCIBT3C
  Bluetooth HCI BT3C (PC Card) driver.
  This driver provides support for Bluetooth PCMCIA devices with
  3Com BT3C interface:
     3Com Bluetooth Card (3CRWB6096)
     HP Bluetooth Card

  The HCI BT3C driver uses external firmware loader program provided in
  the BlueFW package. For more information, see <http://bluez.sf.net>.

  Say Y here to compile support for HCI BT3C devices into the
  kernel or say M to compile it as module (bt3c_cs.o).

HCI BlueCard (PC Card) device driver
CONFIG_BT_HCIBLUECARD
  Bluetooth HCI BlueCard (PC Card) driver.
  This driver provides support for Bluetooth PCMCIA devices with
  Anycom BlueCard interface:
     Anycom Bluetooth PC Card
     Anycom Bluetooth CF Card

  Say Y here to compile support for HCI BlueCard devices into the
  kernel or say M to compile it as module (bluecard_cs.o).
