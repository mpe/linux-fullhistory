config PNP
	bool "Plug and Play support"
	depends on ISA
	---help---
	  Plug and Play (PnP) is a standard for peripherals which allows those
	  peripherals to be configured by software, e.g. assign IRQ's or other
	  parameters. No jumpers on the cards are needed, instead the values
	  are provided to the cards from the BIOS, from the operating system,
	  or using a user-space utility.

	  Say Y here if you would like Linux to configure your Plug and Play
	  devices. You should then also say Y to all of the protocols below.
	  Alternatively, you can say N here and configure your PnP devices
	  using user space utilities such as the isapnptools package.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config PNP_DEBUG
	bool "PnP Debug Messages"
	depends on PNP
	help
	  Say Y if you want the Plug and Play Layer to print debug messages.
	  This is useful if you are developing a PnP driver or troubleshooting.

config ISAPNP
	bool "ISA Plug and Play support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PNP && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Say Y here if you would like support for ISA Plug and Play devices.
	  Some information is in <file:Documentation/isapnp.txt>.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config PNPBIOS
	bool "Plug and Play BIOS support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PNP && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  Linux uses the PNPBIOS as defined in "Plug and Play BIOS
	  Specification Version 1.0A May 5, 1994" to autodetect built-in
	  mainboard resources (e.g. parallel port resources).

	  Some features (e.g. event notification, docking station information,
	  ISAPNP services) are not used.

	  Note: ACPI is expected to supersede PNPBIOS some day, currently it
	  co-exists nicely.

	  See latest pcmcia-cs (stand-alone package) for a nice "lspnp" tools,
	  or have a look at /proc/bus/pnp.

	  If unsure, say Y.
