config IPMI_HANDLER
       tristate 'IPMI top-level message handler'
       help
         This enables the central IPMI message handler, required for IPMI
	 to work.

         IPMI is a standard for managing sensors (temperature,
         voltage, etc.) in a system.

         See Documentation/IPMI.txt for more details on the driver.

	 If unsure, say N.

config IPMI_PANIC_EVENT
       bool 'Generate a panic event to all BMCs on a panic'
       depends on IPMI_HANDLER
       help
         When a panic occurs, this will cause the IPMI message handler to
	 generate an IPMI event describing the panic to each interface
	 registered with the message handler.

config IPMI_DEVICE_INTERFACE
       tristate 'Device interface for IPMI'
       depends on IPMI_HANDLER
       help
         This provides an IOCTL interface to the IPMI message handler so
	 userland processes may use IPMI.  It supports poll() and select().

config IPMI_KCS
       tristate 'IPMI KCS handler'
       depends on IPMI_HANDLER
       help
         Provides a driver for a KCS-style interface to a BMC.

config IPMI_WATCHDOG
       tristate 'IPMI Watchdog Timer'
       depends on IPMI_HANDLER
       help
         This enables the IPMI watchdog timer.
