config WATCHDOG
	bool "Watchdog Timer Support"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here (and to one of the following options) and create a
	  character special file /dev/watchdog with major number 10 and minor
	  number 130 using mknod ("man mknod"), you will get a watchdog, i.e.:
	  subsequently opening the file and then failing to write to it for
	  longer than 1 minute will result in rebooting the machine. This
	  could be useful for a networked machine that needs to come back
	  online as fast as possible after a lock-up. There's both a watchdog
	  implementation entirely in software (which can sometimes fail to
	  reboot the machine) and a driver for hardware watchdog boards, which
	  are more robust and can also keep track of the temperature inside
	  your computer. For details, read <file:Documentation/watchdog/watchdog.txt>
	  in the kernel source.

	  The watchdog is usually used together with the watchdog daemon
	  which is available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/watchdog/>. This daemon can
	  also monitor NFS connections and can reboot the machine when the process
	  table is full.

	  If unsure, say N.

config WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT
	bool "Disable watchdog shutdown on close"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	help
	  The default watchdog behaviour (which you get if you say N here) is
	  to stop the timer if the process managing it closes the file
	  /dev/watchdog. It's always remotely possible that this process might
	  get killed. If you say Y here, the watchdog cannot be stopped once
	  it has been started.

config SOFT_WATCHDOG
	tristate "Software watchdog"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	help
	  A software monitoring watchdog. This will fail to reboot your system
	  from some situations that the hardware watchdog will recover
	  from. Equally it's a lot cheaper to install.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called softdog.

config WDT
	tristate "WDT Watchdog timer"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	---help---
	  If you have a WDT500P or WDT501P watchdog board, say Y here,
	  otherwise N. It is not possible to probe for this board, which means
	  that you have to inform the kernel about the IO port and IRQ using
	  the "wdt=" kernel option (try "man bootparam" or see the
	  documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to
	  pass options to the kernel at boot time).

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called wdt.

config WDT_501
	bool "WDT501 features"
	depends on WDT
	help
	  Saying Y here and creating a character special file /dev/temperature
	  with major number 10 and minor number 131 ("man mknod") will give
	  you a thermometer inside your computer: reading from
	  /dev/temperature yields one byte, the temperature in degrees
	  Fahrenheit. This works only if you have a WDT501P watchdog board
	  installed.

config WDT_501_FAN
	bool "Fan Tachometer"
	depends on WDT_501
	help
	  Enable the Fan Tachometer on the WDT501. Only do this if you have a
	  fan tachometer actually set up.

config WDTPCI
	tristate "WDT PCI Watchdog timer"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	---help---
	  If you have a PCI WDT500/501 watchdog board, say Y here, otherwise
	  N.  It is not possible to probe for this board, which means that you
	  have to inform the kernel about the IO port and IRQ using the "wdt="
	  kernel option (try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of your
	  boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
	  kernel at boot time).

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called wdt_pci.

config WDT_501_PCI
	bool "WDT501-PCI features"
	depends on WDTPCI
	help
	  Saying Y here and creating a character special file /dev/temperature
	  with major number 10 and minor number 131 ("man mknod") will give
	  you a thermometer inside your computer: reading from
	  /dev/temperature yields one byte, the temperature in degrees
	  Fahrenheit. This works only if you have a WDT501P watchdog board
	  installed.

config PCWATCHDOG
	tristate "Berkshire Products PC Watchdog"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	---help---
	  This is the driver for the Berkshire Products PC Watchdog card.
	  This card simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't freeze,
	  and if it does, it reboots your computer after a certain amount of
	  time. This driver is like the WDT501 driver but for different
	  hardware. Please read <file:Documentation/watchdog/pcwd-watchdog.txt>. The PC
	  watchdog cards can be ordered from <http://www.berkprod.com/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called pcwd.

	  Most people will say N.

config ACQUIRE_WDT
	tristate "Acquire SBC Watchdog Timer"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	---help---
	  This is the driver for the hardware watchdog on the PSC-6x86 Single
	  Board Computer produced by Acquire Inc (and others).  This watchdog
	  simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't freeze, and if
	  it does, it reboots your computer after a certain amount of time.
	  This driver is like the WDT501 driver but for different hardware.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called acquirewdt.

	tristate "Advantech SBC Watchdog Timer"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	help
	  If you are configuring a Linux kernel for the Advantech single-board
	  computer, say `Y' here to support its built-in watchdog timer
	  feature.  See the help for CONFIG_WATCHDOG for discussion.

config 21285_WATCHDOG
	tristate "DC21285 watchdog"
	depends on WATCHDOG && FOOTBRIDGE
	help
	  The Intel Footbridge chip contains a builtin watchdog circuit. Say Y
	  here if you wish to use this. Alternatively say M to compile the
	  driver as a module, which will be called wdt285.

	  This driver does not work on all machines. In particular, early CATS
	  boards have hardware problems that will cause the machine to simply
	  lock up if the watchdog fires.

	  "If in doubt, leave it out" - say N.

config 977_WATCHDOG
	tristate "NetWinder WB83C977 watchdog"
	depends on WATCHDOG && FOOTBRIDGE && ARCH_NETWINDER
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for the WB977 watchdog included in
	  NetWinder machines. Alternatively say M to compile the driver as
	  a module, which will be called wdt977.

	  Not sure? It's safe to say N.

config SA1100_WATCHDOG
	tristate "SA1100 watchdog"
	depends on WATCHDOG && ARCH_SA1100
	help
	  Watchdog timer embedded into SA11x0 chips. This will reboot your

	depends on WATCHDOG
	---help---
	  This is the driver for the hardware watchdog on the IB700 Single
	  Board Computer produced by TMC Technology (www.tmc-uk.com). This watchdog
	  simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't freeze, and if
	  it does, it reboots your computer after a certain amount of time.

	  This driver is like the WDT501 driver but for slightly different hardware.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ib700wdt.

	  Most people will say N.

config I810_TCO
	tristate "Intel i8xx TCO timer / Watchdog"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	---help---
	  Hardware driver for the TCO timer built into the Intel i8xx
	  chipset family.  The TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) timer is a
	  watchdog timer that will reboot the machine after its second
	  expiration. The expiration time can be configured by commandline
	  argument "i810_margin=<n>" where <n> is the counter initial value.
	  It is decremented every 0.6 secs, the default is 50 which gives a
	  timeout of 30 seconds and one minute until reset.

	  On some motherboards the driver may fail to reset the chipset's
	  NO_REBOOT flag which prevents the watchdog from rebooting the
	  machine. If this is the case you will get a kernel message like
	  "i810tco init: failed to reset NO_REBOOT flag".

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called i810-tco.

config MIXCOMWD
	tristate "Mixcom Watchdog"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the Mixcom hardware watchdog cards.  This
	  watchdog simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't freeze,
	  and if it does, it reboots your computer after a certain amount of
	  time.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called mixcomwd.

config 60XX_WDT
	tristate "SBC-60XX Watchdog Timer"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	help
	  This driver can be used with the watchdog timer found on some
	  single board computers, namely the 6010 PII based computer.
	  It may well work with other cards.  It reads port 0x443 to enable
	  and re-set the watchdog timer, and reads port 0x45 to disable
	  the watchdog.  If you have a card that behave in similar ways,
	  you can probably make this driver work with your card as well.

	  You can compile this driver directly into the kernel, or use
	  it as a module.  The module will be called sbc60xxwdt.
