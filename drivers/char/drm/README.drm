The Direct Rendering Manager (drm) is a device-independent kernel-level
device driver that provides support for the XFree86 Direct Rendering
Infrastructure (DRI).

The DRM supports the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) in four major
ways:

    1. The DRM provides synchronized access to the graphics hardware via
       the use of an optimized two-tiered lock.

    2. The DRM enforces the DRI security policy for access to the graphics
       hardware by only allowing authenticated X11 clients access to
       restricted regions of memory.

    3. The DRM provides a generic DMA engine, complete with multiple
       queues and the ability to detect the need for an OpenGL context
       switch.

    4. The DRM is extensible via the use of small device-specific modules
       that rely extensively on the API exported by the DRM module.
