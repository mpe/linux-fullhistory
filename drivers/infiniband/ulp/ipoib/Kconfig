config INFINIBAND_IPOIB
	tristate "IP-over-InfiniBand"
	depends on INFINIBAND && NETDEVICES && INET
	---help---
	  Support for the IP-over-InfiniBand protocol (IPoIB). This
	  transports IP packets over InfiniBand so you can use your IB
	  device as a fancy NIC.

	  The IPoIB protocol is defined by the IETF ipoib working
	  group: <http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ipoib-charter.html>.

config INFINIBAND_IPOIB_DEBUG
	bool "IP-over-InfiniBand debugging"
	depends on INFINIBAND_IPOIB
	---help---
	  This option causes debugging code to be compiled into the
	  IPoIB driver.  The output can be turned on via the
	  debug_level and mcast_debug_level module parameters (which
	  can also be set after the driver is loaded through sysfs).

	  This option also creates an "ipoib_debugfs," which can be
	  mounted to expose debugging information about IB multicast
	  groups used by the IPoIB driver.

config INFINIBAND_IPOIB_DEBUG_DATA
	bool "IP-over-InfiniBand data path debugging"
	depends on INFINIBAND_IPOIB_DEBUG
	---help---
	  This option compiles debugging code into the the data path
	  of the IPoIB driver.  The output can be turned on via the
	  data_debug_level module parameter; however, even with output
	  turned off, this debugging code will have some performance
	  impact.
