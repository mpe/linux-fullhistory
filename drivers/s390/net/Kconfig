config LCS
	tristate "Lan Channel Station Interface"
	depends on NETDEVICES && (NET_ETHERNET || TR || FDDI)
	help
	   Select this option if you want to use LCS networking  on IBM S/390
  	   or zSeries. This device driver supports Token Ring (IEEE 802.5),
  	   FDDI (IEEE 802.7) and Ethernet. 
	   This option is also available as a module which will be
	   called lcs.ko. If you do not know what it is, it's safe to say "Y".

config CTC
	tristate "CTC device support"
	depends on NETDEVICES
	help
	  Select this option if you want to use channel-to-channel networking
	  on IBM S/390 or zSeries. This device driver supports real CTC
	  coupling using ESCON. It also supports virtual CTCs when running
	  under VM. It will use the channel device configuration if this is
	  available.  This option is also available as a module which will be
	  called ctc.ko.  If you do not know what it is, it's safe to say "Y".

config IUCV
	tristate "IUCV device support (VM only)"
	depends on NETDEVICES
	help
	  Select this option if you want to use inter-user communication
	  vehicle networking under VM or VIF.  This option is also available
	  as a module which will be called iucv.ko. If unsure, say "Y".


config QETH
	tristate "Gigabit Ethernet device support"
	depends on NETDEVICES && IP_MULTICAST && QDIO
	help
	  This driver supports the IBM S/390 and zSeries OSA Express adapters
	  in QDIO mode (all media types), HiperSockets interfaces and VM GuestLAN
	  interfaces in QDIO and HIPER mode.
	
	  For details please refer to the documentation provided by IBM at   
	  <http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/linux390>

	  This driver is also available as a module (code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
	  want). If you want to compile it as a module, say 'M' here and
	  read file Documentation/modules.txt.

# FIXME IPV6=m && QETH=y
config QETH_IPV6
	bool "IPv6 support for gigabit ethernet"
	depends on QETH && IPV6
	help
	  If CONFIG_QETH is switched on, this option will include IPv6
	  support in the qeth device driver.

# FIXME VLAN_8021Q=m && QETH=y
config QETH_VLAN
	bool "VLAN support for gigabit ethernet"
	depends on QETH && VLAN_8021Q
	help
	  If CONFIG_QETH is switched on, this option will include IEEE
	  802.1q VLAN support in the qeth device driver.

config QETH_PERF_STATS
	bool "Performance statistics in /proc"
	depends on QETH
	help
	  When switched on, this option will add a file in the proc-fs
	  (/proc/qeth_perf_stats) containing performance statistics. It
	  may slightly impact performance, so this is only recommended for
	  internal tuning of the device driver.
