/**
 * Interface notes:
 *
 * The ioctl()s which are implemented (along with relevant details)
 * are:
 *
 *   ICARSAMODEXPO
 *     Perform an RSA operation using a Modulus-Exponent pair
 *     This takes an ica_rsa_modexpo struct as its arg.
 *
 *     NOTE: please refer to the comments preceding this structure
 *           for the implementation details for the contents of the
 *           block
 *
 *   ICARSACRT
 *     Perform an RSA operation using a Chinese-Remainder Theorem key
 *     This takes an ica_rsa_modexpo_crt struct as its arg.
 *
 *     NOTE: please refer to the comments preceding this structure
 *           for the implementation details for the contents of the
 *           block
 *
 *   Z90STAT_TOTALCOUNT
 *     Return an integer count of all device types together.
 *
 *   Z90STAT_PCICACOUNT
 *     Return an integer count of all PCICAs.
 *
 *   Z90STAT_PCICCCOUNT
 *     Return an integer count of all PCICCs.
 *
 *   Z90STAT_PCIXCCMCL2COUNT
 *     Return an integer count of all MCL2 PCIXCCs.
 *
 *   Z90STAT_PCIXCCMCL3COUNT
 *     Return an integer count of all MCL3 PCIXCCs.
 *
 *   Z90STAT_CEX2CCOUNT
 *     Return an integer count of all CEX2Cs.
 *
 *   Z90STAT_REQUESTQ_COUNT
 *     Return an integer count of the number of entries waiting to be
 *     sent to a device.
 *
 *   Z90STAT_PENDINGQ_COUNT
 *     Return an integer count of the number of entries sent to a
 *     device awaiting the reply.
 *
 *   Z90STAT_TOTALOPEN_COUNT
 *     Return an integer count of the number of open file handles.
 *
 *   Z90STAT_DOMAIN_INDEX
 *     Return the integer value of the Cryptographic Domain.
 *
 *   Z90STAT_STATUS_MASK
 *     Return an 64 element array of unsigned chars for the status of
 *     all devices.
 *       0x01: PCICA
 *       0x02: PCICC
 *       0x03: PCIXCC_MCL2
 *       0x04: PCIXCC_MCL3
 *       0x05: CEX2C
 *       0x0d: device is disabled via the proc filesystem
 *
 *   Z90STAT_QDEPTH_MASK
 *     Return an 64 element array of unsigned chars for the queue
 *     depth of all devices.
 *
 *   Z90STAT_PERDEV_REQCNT
 *     Return an 64 element array of unsigned integers for the number
 *     of successfully completed requests per device since the device
 *     was detected and made available.
 *
 *   ICAZ90STATUS (deprecated)
 *     Return some device driver status in a ica_z90_status struct
 *     This takes an ica_z90_status struct as its arg.
 *
 *     NOTE: this ioctl() is deprecated, and has been replaced with
 *           single ioctl()s for each type of status being requested
 *
 *   Z90STAT_PCIXCCCOUNT (deprecated)
 *     Return an integer count of all PCIXCCs (MCL2 + MCL3).
 *     This is DEPRECATED now that MCL3 PCIXCCs are treated differently from
 *     MCL2 PCIXCCs.
 *
 *   Z90QUIESCE (not recommended)
 *     Quiesce the driver.  This is intended to stop all new
 *     requests from being processed.  Its use is NOT recommended,
 *     except in circumstances where there is no other way to stop
 *     callers from accessing the driver.  Its original use was to
 *     allow the driver to be "drained" of work in preparation for
 *     a system shutdown.
 *
 *     NOTE: once issued, this ban on new work cannot be undone
 *           except by unloading and reloading the driver.
