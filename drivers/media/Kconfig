	  Support for audio/video capture and overlay devices and FM radio
	  cards. The exact capabilities of each device vary. User tools for
	  this are available from
	  <ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/video4linux/>.

	  This kernel includes support for the new Video for Linux Two API,
	  (V4L2) as well as the original system. Drivers and applications
	  need to be rewritten to use V4L2, but drivers for popular cards
	  and applications for most video capture functions already exist.

	  Documentation for the original API is included in the file
	  Documentation/video4linux/API.html.  Documentation for V4L2 is
	  available on the web at http://bytesex.org/v4l/

	  This driver is also available as a module called videodev.o ( = code
	  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
	  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
	  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
