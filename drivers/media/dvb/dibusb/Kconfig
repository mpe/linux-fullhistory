	  Support for USB 1.1 DVB-T devices based on a reference design made by
	  DiBcom (http://www.dibcom.fr).

	  Devices supported by this driver:

	    TwinhanDTV USB-Ter (VP7041)
		TwinhanDTV Magic Box (VP7041e)
	    KWorld V-Stream XPERT DTV - DVB-T USB
	    Hama DVB-T USB-Box
	    DiBcom reference device (non-public)
	    Ultima Electronic/Artec T1 USB TVBOX
	    Compro Videomate DVB-U2000 - DVB-T USB

	  The VP7041 seems to be identical to "CTS Portable" (Chinese
	  Television System).

	  These devices can be understood as budget ones, they "only" deliver
	  the MPEG data.

	  Currently all known copies of the DiBcom reference design have the DiBcom 3000-MB 
	  frontend onboard. Please enable and load this one manually in order to use this
	  device.

	  A firmware is needed to use the device. See Documentation/dvb/README.dibusb
	  details.

	  Say Y if you own such a device and want to use it. You should build it as
	  a module.
