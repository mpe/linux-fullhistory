	  Support for USB 1.1 and 2.0 DVB-T devices based on reference designs made by
	  DiBcom (http://www.dibcom.fr) and C&E.

	  Devices supported by this driver:

	    TwinhanDTV USB-Ter (VP7041)
		TwinhanDTV Magic Box (VP7041e)
	    KWorld V-Stream XPERT DTV - DVB-T USB
	    Hama DVB-T USB-Box
	    DiBcom reference devices (non-public)
	    Ultima Electronic/Artec T1 USB TVBOX
	    Compro Videomate DVB-U2000 - DVB-T USB
	    Grandtec DVB-T USB
	    Avermedia AverTV DVBT USB
	    Artec T1 USB1.1 and USB2.0 boxes
	    Yakumo/Typhoon DVB-T USB2.0
	    Hanftek UMT-010 USB2.0

	  The VP7041 seems to be identical to "CTS Portable" (Chinese
	  Television System).

	  These devices can be understood as budget ones, they "only" deliver
	  (a part of) the MPEG2 transport stream.

	  A firmware is needed to get the device working. See Documentation/dvb/README.dibusb
	  details.

	  Say Y if you own such a device and want to use it. You should build it as
	  a module.

	  Somehow Artec/Ultima Electronic forgot to program the eeprom of some of their
	  USB1.1/USB2.0 devices.
	  So comes that they identify with the default Vendor and Product ID of the Cypress
	  CY7C64613 (AN2235) or Cypress FX2.

	  Affected device IDs:
	    0x0574:0x2235 (Artec T1 USB1.1, cold)
	    0x04b4:0x8613 (Artec T1 USB2.0, cold)
	    0x0574:0x1002 (Artec T1 USB2.0, warm)
	    0x0574:0x2131 (aged DiBcom USB1.1 test device)

	  Say Y if your device has one of the mentioned IDs.

	  Say Y if you want to enable debuging. See modinfo dvb-dibusb for
	  debug levels.
