	  Support for SAA7146 and AV7110 based DVB cards as produced 
	  by Fujitsu-Siemens, Technotrend, Hauppauge and others.

	  Simple cards like so called Budget- or Nova-PCI cards are 
	  supported as well as fullfeatured cards with onboard MPEG2 
	  decoder.

	  Say Y if you own such a card and want to use it.

	  The AV7110 firmware provides some code to generate an OnScreenDisplay
	  on the video output. This is kind of nonstandard and not guaranteed to
	  be maintained.

	  Anyway, some popular DVB software like VDR uses this OSD to render
	  its menus, so say Y if you want to use this software.

	  All other people say N.
