Please see the file README.BusLogic for information about Linux support for
Mylex (formerly BusLogic) MultiMaster and FlashPoint SCSI Host Adapters.

The Mylex DAC960 PCI RAID Controllers are not supported at the present time,
but work on a Linux driver for the DAC960 is in progress.  Please consult
http://www.dandelion.com/Linux/ for further information on the DAC960 driver.
