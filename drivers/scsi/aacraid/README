AACRAID Driver for Linux (take two)

Introduction
-------------------------
The aacraid driver adds support for Adaptec (http://www.adaptec.com)
RAID controllers. This is a major rewrite from the original 
Adaptec supplied driver. It has signficantly cleaned up both the code
and the running binary size (the module is less than half the size of
the original).

People
-------------------------
Alan Cox <alan@redhat.com>
Christoph Hellwig <hch@infradead.org>	(updates for new-style PCI probing and SCSI host registration,
					 small cleanups/fixes)
Matt Domsch <matt_domsch@dell.com>	(revision ioctl, adapter messages)
Deanna Bonds <deanna_bonds@adaptec.com> (non-DASD support, PAE fibs and 64 bit, added new adaptec controllers
					 added new ioctls, changed scsi interface to use new error handler,
					 increased the number of fibs and outstanding commands to a container)

					(fixed 64bit and 64G memory model, changed confusing naming convention
					 where fibs that go to the hardware are consistently called hw_fibs and
					 not just fibs like the name of the driver tracking structure)

None currently. Also note this is very different to Brian's original driver
so don't expect him to support it.
Adaptec does support this driver.  Contact either tech support or deanna bonds.
