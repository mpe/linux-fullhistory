AACRAID Driver for Linux (take two)

Introduction
-------------------------
The aacraid driver adds support for Adaptec (http://www.adaptec.com)
RAID controllers. This is a major rewrite from the original 
Adaptec supplied driver. It has signficantly cleaned up both the code
and the running binary size (the module is less than half the size of
the original).

None currently. Also note this is very different to Brian's original driver
so don't expect him to support it.
Adaptec does support this driver.  Contact either tech support or deanna bonds.
