config SCSI_AIC7XXX
	tristate "New driver"
	help
	  This driver supports all of Adaptec's PCI based SCSI controllers
	  (not the hardware RAID controllers though) as well as the aic7770
	  based EISA and VLB SCSI controllers (the 274x and 284x series).
	  This is an Adaptec sponsored driver written by Justin Gibbs.  It is
	  intended to replace the previous aic7xxx driver maintained by Doug
	  Ledford since Doug is no longer maintaining that driver.


config AIC7XXX_CMDS_PER_DEVICE
	int "Maximum number of TCQ commands per device"
	depends on SCSI_AIC7XXX
	default "253"
	---help---
	  Specify the number of commands you would like to allocate per SCSI
	  device when Tagged Command Queueing (TCQ) is enabled on that device.

	  This is an upper bound value for the number of tagged transactions
	  to be used for any device.  The aic7xxx driver will automatically
	  vary this number based on device behavior.  For devices with a
	  fixed maximum, the driver will eventually lock to this maximum
	  and display a console message inidicating this value.

	  Note: Unless you experience some type of device failure, the default
	  	value, no enforced limit, should work for you.

	  Default: 253

config AIC7XXX_RESET_DELAY_MS
	int "Initial bus reset delay in milli-seconds"
	depends on SCSI_AIC7XXX
	default "15000"
	help
	  The number of milliseconds to delay after an initial bus reset.
	  The bus settle delay following all error recovery actions is
	  dictated by the SCSI layer and is not affected by this value.

	  Default: 15000 (15 seconds)

config AIC7XXX_BUILD_FIRMWARE
	bool "Build Adapter Firmware with Kernel Build"
	depends on SCSI_AIC7XXX
	help
	  This option should only be enabled if you are modifying the firmware
	  source to the aic7xxx driver and wish to have the generated firmware
	  include files updated during a normal kernel build.  The assembler
	  for the firmware requires lex and yacc or their equivalents, as well
	  as the db v1 library.  You may have to install additional packages
	  or modify the assembler make file or the files it includes if your
	  build environment is different than that of the author.
