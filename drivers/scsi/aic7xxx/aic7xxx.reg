/*
 * Serial EEPROM Control (p. 4-92 in 7870 Databook)
 * Controls the reading and writing of an external serial 1-bit
 * EEPROM Device.  In order to access the serial EEPROM, you must
 * first set the SEEMS bit that generates a request to the memory
 * port for access to the serial EEPROM device.  When the memory
 * port is not busy servicing another request, it reconfigures
 * to allow access to the serial EEPROM.  When this happens, SEERDY
 * gets set high to verify that the memory port access has been
 * granted.  
 *
 * After successful arbitration for the memory port, the SEECS bit of 
 * the SEECTL register is connected to the chip select.  The SEECK, 
 * SEEDO, and SEEDI are connected to the clock, data out, and data in 
 * lines respectively.  The SEERDY bit of SEECTL is useful in that it 
 * gives us an 800 nsec timer.  After a write to the SEECTL register, 
 * the SEERDY goes high 800 nsec later.  The one exception to this is 
 * when we first request access to the memory port.  The SEERDY goes 
 * high to signify that access has been granted and, for this case, has 
 * no implied timing.
 *
 * See 93cx6.c for detailed information on the protocol necessary to 
 * read the serial EEPROM.

 * BIOS trashes 20-2f, writing the synchronous negotiation results
 * on top of the BIOS values, so we re-use those for our per-target
 * scratchspace (actually a value that can be copied directly into
 * SCSIRATE).  The kernel driver will enable synchronous negotiation
 * for all targets that have a value other than 0 in the lower four
 * bits of the target scratch space.  This should work regardless of
