**  This driver has been ported to Linux from the FreeBSD NCR53C8XX driver
**  and is currently maintained by
**
**          Gerard Roudier              <groudier@free.fr>
**
**  Being given that this driver originates from the FreeBSD version, and
**  in order to keep synergy on both, any suggested enhancements and corrections
**  received on Linux are automatically a potential candidate for the FreeBSD 
**  version.
**
**  The original driver has been written for 386bsd and FreeBSD by
**          Wolfgang Stanglmeier        <wolf@cologne.de>
**          Stefan Esser                <se@mi.Uni-Koeln.de>
**
**  And has been ported to NetBSD by
**          Charles M. Hannum           <mycroft@gnu.ai.mit.edu>
