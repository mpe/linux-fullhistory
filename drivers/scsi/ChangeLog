	Post-codefreeze thaw...

	* buslogic.[c,h]: New driver from David Gentzel.

	* hosts.h: Add use_clustering field to explicitly say whether
	clustering should be used for devices attached to this host
	adapter.  The buslogic board apparently supports large SG lists,
	but it is apparently faster if sd.c condenses this into a smaller
	list.

	* sd.c: Use this field instead of heuristic.

	* All host adapter include files: Add appropriate initializer for
	use_clustering field.

	* scsi.h: Add #defines for return codes for the abort and reset
	functions.  There are now a specific set of return codes to fully
	specify all of the possible things that the low-level adapter
	could do.

	* scsi.c: Act based upon return codes from abort/reset functions.

	* All host adapter abort/reset functions: Return new return code.

	* Add code in scsi.c to help debug timeouts.  Use #define
	DEBUG_TIMEOUT to enable this.

	* scsi.c: If the host->irq field is set, use
	disable_irq/enable_irq before calling queuecommand if we
	are not already in an interrupt.  Reduce races, and we
	can be sloppier about cli/sti in the interrupt routines now
	(reduce interrupt latency).

	* constants.c: Fix some things to eliminate warnings.  Add some
	sense descriptions that were omitted before.

	* aha1542.c: Watch for SCRD from host adapter - if we see it, set
	a flag.  Currently we only print out the number of pending
	commands that might need to be restarted.

	* aha1542.c (aha1542_abort): Look for lost interrupts, OGMB still
	full, and attempt to recover.  Otherwise give up.

	* aha1542.c (aha1542_reset): Try BUS DEVICE RESET, and then pass
	DID_RESET back up to the upper level code for all commands running
	on this target (even on different LUNs).

Sat May  7 14:54:01 1994

	* Linux 1.1.12 released.

	* st.c, st.h: New version from Kai.  Supports boot time
	specification of number of buffers.

	verify_area in GET_IDLUN ioctl.  Add new ioctls for
	TAGGED_QUEUE_ENABLE, DISABLE.  Only allow IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND by
	superuser.

	* sd.c: Only pay attention to UNIT_ATTENTION for removable disks.
	Fix bug where sometimes portions of blocks would get lost
	resulting in processes hanging.  Add messages when we spin up a
	disk, and fix a bug in the timing.  Increase read-ahead for disks
	that are on a scatter-gather capable host adapter.

	* seagate.c: Fix so that some parameters can be set from the lilo
	prompt.  Supply jumpstart flag if we are resetting and need the
	command restarted.   Fix so that we return 1 if we detect a card
	so that multiple card detection works correctly.  Add yet another
	signature for FD cards (950).  Add another signature for ST0x.

	* sg.c, sg.h: New files from Lawrence Foard for generic scsi
	access.

	* sr.c:  Add type casts for (void*) so that we can do pointer

    in a loop whereby the device returns null sense data.

    * sd.c: Add code to spin up a drive if it is not already spinning.
    Do this one at a time to make it easier on power supplies.

    * sd_ioctl.c: Use sync_dev instead of fsync_dev in BLKFLSBUF ioctl.

    * hosts.c: Do not depend upon Makefile generated count of the number
    of low-level host adapters.

    * scsi.c: Use array for scsi_command_size instead of a function.  Add
    Texel cdrom and Maxtor XT-4380S to blacklist.  Allow compile time
    option for no-multi lun scan.  Add semaphore for possible problems
    with handshaking, assume device is faulty until we know it not to be
    the case.  Add DEBUG_INIT symbol to dump info as we scan for devices.
    Zero sense buffer so we can tell if we need to request it.  When
    examining sense information, request sense if buffer is all zero.
    If RESET, request sense information to see what to do next.

    * scsi_debug.c: Change some constants to use symbols like INT_MAX.

    * scsi_ioctl.c (kernel_scsi_ioctl): New function -for making ioctl
    calls from kernel space.

    * sd.c: Increase timeout to 300.  Use functions in constants.h to
    display info.  Use scsi_malloc buffer for READ_CAPACITY, since
    we cannot guarantee that a stack based buffer is < 16Mb.

    * sd_ioctl.c: Add BLKFLSBUF ioctl.

    * seagate.c: Add new compile time options for ARBITRATE,
    SLOW_HANDSHAKE, and SLOW_RATE.  Update assembly loops for transferring

    * fdomain.c: Update to version 3.17 from 3.6.  Now works with
    TMC-18C50.

    * scsi.c: Minor changes here and there with datatypes.  Save use_sg
    when requesting sense information so that this can properly be
    restored if we retry the command.  Set aside dma buffers assuming each
    block is 1 page, not 1Kb minix block.

    * scsi_ioctl.c: Add a few type casts.  Other minor changes.

    * sd.c:  Correctly  free all scsi_malloc'd memory if we run out of
    dma_pool. Store blocksize information for each partition.

    get decremented past zero.

    * sd.c: Add block_fsync function to dispatch table.

    * sr.c: Increase timeout to 500 from 250.  Add entry for sync in
    dispatch table (supply NULL).  If we do not have a sectorsize,

    obtain sectorsize.

    * sr.h: Add needs_sector_size semaphore.

    * st.c: Add NULL for fsync in dispatch table.

    (allocate_device): Fix race condition.  Allow more space in dma pool
    for blocksizes of up to 4Kb.

    * scsi.h: Define COMMAND_SIZE.  Define a SCSI specific version of
    INIT_REQUEST that can run with interrupts off.

    * scsi_ioctl.c: Make ioctl_probe function more idiot-proof.  If
    a removable device says ILLEGAL REQUEST to a door-locking command,
    clear lockable flag.  Add SCSI_IOCTL_GET_IDLUN ioctl.  Do not attempt
    to lock door for devices that do not have lockable semaphore set.

    * sd.c: Fix race condition for multiple disks.  Use INIT_SCSI_REQUEST
    instead of INIT_REQUEST.  Allow sector sizes of 1024 and 256.  For
    removable disks that are not ready, mark them as having a media change
    (some drives do not report this later).

    * seagate.c: Use volatile keyword for memory-mapped register pointers.

    * sr.c: Fix race condition, a la sd.c.  Increase the number of retries
    to 1.  Use INIT_SCSI_REQUEST.  Allow 512 byte sector sizes.  Do a
    read_capacity when we init the device so we know the size and
    sectorsize.

    * st.c: If ioctl not found in st.c, try scsi_ioctl for others.

    * ultrastor.c: Do not truncate number of cylinders at 1024 for

    * scsi.c: Ignore leading spaces when looking for blacklisted devices.

    * seagate.c: Add a few new signatures for FD cards.  Another patch
    with SCint to fix race condition.  Use recursion_depth to keep track
    of how many times we have been recursively called, and do not start
    another command unless we are on the outer level.  Fixes bug
    with Syquest cartridge drives (used to crash kernel), because
    they do not disconnect with large data transfers.

Tue Jan 12 14:33:36 1993  

    * 0.99pl3 released.

    * fdomain.c: Update to version 3.3 (a few new signatures).

Wed Dec 30 20:03:47 1992  

    * 0.99pl2 released.

    * scsi.c: Blacklist back in.  Remove Newbury drive as other bugfix
    eliminates need for it here.

    (sd_init) Init blkdev_fops earlier so that sd_open is available sooner.

    * sr.c: Same as above for sd.c.

    * st.c: Return ENODEV instead of ENXIO if no device.  Init chrdev_fops
    sooner, so that it is always there even if no tapes.

    * seagate.c (controller_type): New variable to keep track of ST0x or
    FD.  Modify signatures list to indicate controller type, and init
    controller_type once we find a match.
