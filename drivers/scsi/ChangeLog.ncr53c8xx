Fri Aug 30  10:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c - Version 1.12c
	Incorporate the changes of FreeBSD/ncr.c revision 1.76.
	The changes add support for the 53c860 and 53c875, 
	but without taking advantage of the new features.
	Those chips are used exactly as the old 53c810.

Sun Jul 21  00:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c, README.ncr53c8xx
	Add the ncr53c8xx_select_queue_depths() function.
	Set queue_depth to SCSI_NCR_MAX_TAGS (4 by default) for devices that 
	support tagged command queueing.
	For other devices, set queue_depth to 1. No need to queue a command 
	to the driver if this command cannot be sent to the device.
	Each time the driver hide io requests from the kernel and/or from the 
	driver, it may break a little (or a lot) optimization algorithms that 
	try to increase throughput by reordering io requests.
	It is better to enable the disk write caching to reduce latencies for 
	write operations, and to trust asynchronous read ahead from the device 
	and from the kernel that can reduce latencies for read operations, 
	even when tagged command queuing is not supported or enabled.

Sat Jul 20  20:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Minor changes:
	- Problem of "CCB address mismatch" that happens with the 3 versions 
	  of the driver. The CCB is correct and Stefan Esser suggests a little 
	  patch that seems to be a bypass.
	  Stefan says he will change that in a future version of the BSD driver.
	- Set burst transfers to 8 for 815 chips.

Sun Jul 14  15:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c, Configure.help
	Memory mapped io donnot work under linux/Alpha for the driver.
	For the moment it is better to not support this feature for this 
	architecture.

Tue Jul 09  20:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Garbage printed out with the following command (fixed):
	- cat <some proc scsi device> /proc/scsi/ncr53c8xx/0

Sun Jul 07  20:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Tagged command queueing cannot be disabled at run time.
	I probably never try that because I felt the risk.
	Shortest patch sent to Linus. I have to plan something better.

Wed Jul 03  23:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Release 1.12a
	Tested linux releases: 1.2.13, 2.0.0, 2.0.1

Mon Jul 01  21:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	ncr53c8xx.h, ncr53c8xx.c
	Add "clearprof" user command that clear the profile counters.
	Automatically clear profile counters when num_kbytes=1000000000 
	in order to avoid ugly overflow.
	Donnot compile user command code and profile data with 1.2.13.

Wed Jun 29  20:38 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Matthew Geier reported to me a weird problem of unexpected 
	disconnection while asynchronous negotiation.
	The message sent by the driver is 1-3-1-ff-00. I sent a patch to 
	Matthew that change the message to 1-3-1-00-00.
	The sync msgout was correct however some devices might be to happy 
	with ff.

Wed Jun 26  22:57 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Patch no 4 sent to Harald.
	The drived used "wtime" for timeouts adn time measurements.
	I change for jiffies.
	Work with my P133.

Mon Jun 24  23:05 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Patch no 3 sent to Harald.

Sun Jun 23  22:29 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Patch no 2 sent to Harald.
	I think that the driver have some chance to work.
	
Sun Jun 23  15:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Harald Koenig is interested in the adaptation of the driver to 
	Linux/Alpha.
	I have prepared a patch and sent it to Harald.

Sun Jun 16  19:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Release 1.11
	Tested linux releases: 1.2.13, 2.0.0

Sat Jun 15 23:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.h, Configure.help, scsi/Config.in
	Add CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_IOMAPPED config option.
	Prepare the 2.0.0 with the new version of the driver.

Wed Jun 12 23:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Rewrite the README file.
	Add some documentations of the proc file system support.

Sun Jun 9 18:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Add proc filesystem support of the driver.
	Read operations returns profile information.
	Write operations send control commands to the host adapter driver.

Wed Jun 5 22:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Change xfer direction for SCAN command to write.
	Was bogus.

Tue May 30 18:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Set the DMA FIFO to 88 for 825A and 875 boards.
	The previous value of 536 is bogus since the script only read 7 
	bits for the fifo size (thanks to Stefan).

Mon May 27 18:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Correct the xfer direction guessing for scanner SCAN command (write).

Mon May 27 18:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Add the following config options:
	SCSI_NCR_DISABLE_MPARITY_CHECK : disable master parity checking.
	SCSI_NCR_DISABLE_PARITY_CHECK  : disable scsi parity checking.
	SCSI_NCR_FORCE_SYNC_NEGO       : force sync nego for all scsi 2 devices.

Sat May 25 22:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Release 1.10
	Tested linux releases: 1.2.13, 1.3.45, 1.3.71, 1.3.90, 1.3.100
	                       1.99.6, 1.99.7
	Switch between Drew's driver and Bsd driver tested for 1.99.7.
	Both driver was made as modules.

Sat May 25 16:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Some weird problems happen with multi-lun configurations and HDs.
	SDTR seems to be sent with TEST UNIT READY of lun 1.
	Tagged Queue cannot be enabled. It seems that inqdata are 
	filled with garbage probably due to some INQUIRY command to
	lun 1.
	I have fixed the problem as follow:
	- negotiation are initiated only with a command to lun 0.
	- inquiry data are store only for lun 0.

Wed May 22 22:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c, ncr53c8xx.h
	Have prepared the patch that allow to install the driver in the 
	kernel tree, without moving Drew's one.
	Seems to work. However, I have to check that nothing has been 
	broken for 1.2.13 and 1.3.45 to 1.3.100.

Sun May 4 22:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.h
	Adapt the source to some modifications of the linux tree of 1.3.98.
	(include/linux/scsicam.h moved to include/scsi/scsicam.h)

Thu Apr 25 21:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.h, ncr53c8xx.c
	Release 1.9
	Prepare conditionnal compilations for the future Linux version(s).
	Assume that these versions will be nicely compatible with current 
	one. 
	1.3.255, 1.4.0 or 2.0.0 ?
	I suggest 3.0.0 for some obvious reason.

Wed Apr 24 23:15 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* Install.ncr53c8xx
	Add Patch-Current.ncr53c8xx to the distribution.
	This patch is applied to the scsi Makefile at installation time for
	Linux release V.P.S (V*1000000000+P*100000000+S > 1300000094).
	Each time it'll be necessary I will send the patch corresponding to 
	the current Linux release to the linux-scsi@vger.rutgers.edu.

Sun Apr 21 19:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* README.ncr53c8xx
	Update Bonnie results of linux-1.3.92 + prepatch read-ahead 1.3.93.
	Results are so good that I must remove FreeBSD-2.0.5 results from the
	README file, otherwise I should cause trouble for myself.

Sun Apr 07 21:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.h
	Define SCSI_NCR_MAX_LUN (8) inconditionaly.
	Previous releases did not work for multi-lun devices.
	This definition was wrongly conditionned:
	(SCSI_CONFIG_MULTI_LUN instead of CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN).
	No luck, since I donnot have multi-lun devices and could'nt
	test it.
	Some tests under linux-1.3.84 with an experimental patch that
	try to do asynchronous read-ahead.

Wed Apr 03 23:15 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.h, ncr53c8xx.c
	Change some wrong "assert (target == cmd->target & 7)" to
                          "assert (target == (cmd->target & 0xf)".
	Remove   NCR_TIMEOUT_ALERT from ncr53c8xx.c
	Add SCSI_NCR_TIMEOUT_ALERT to   ncr53c8xx.h

Sun Mar 24 21:15 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.h
	During "make dep" of linux-1.2.13, LINUX_VERSION_CODE is undefined.
	Have to assume 1.2.13 in such situation.
	Release 1.8

Sun Mar 24 21:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* README.ncr53c8xx
	Make changes according to the new uninstallation procedure.

Sun Mar 24 20:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* Uninstall.ncr53c8xx
	Add an uninstallation script to the distribution.
	This shell script restore the standard driver.
	Very usefull for people who prefers to use a driver that
	does not support:
	- Master parity check
	- Tagged command queuing
	- Fast Wide Scsi-2 features (up to 20 MB/sec)
	and that would be capable to reject a Wide Negotiation that it had
	previously initiated.

Sat Mar 23 22:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* README.ncr53c8xx
	Make changes according to the new installation procedure.

Fri Mar 22 23:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* Install.ncr53c8xx
	Add an installation script to the distribution.
	3 differents patches are necessary:
	- linux-1.2.13
	- linux-1.3.45 to linux-1.3.49
        - linux-1.3.50 to linux-1.3.77

Wed Mar 13 22:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c, ncr53c8xx.h
	Add share irq support.
	This facility appears with linux-1.3.70. It seems that the
	corresponding code of the kernel was questionnable before 1.3.72.
	I decide to support this options from linux-1.3.72 and above.
	(Add define option SCSI_NCR_SHARE_IRQ)
	Release 1.7

Tue Mar 12 22:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Download BSD ncr.c 1.67 and apply the correction of negotiations order.
	Now the Wide and Sync negotiation are done in the proper order.
	(Problem reported by Johannes Plass).
	Round up correctly the announced speed in MB/sec.

Tue Mar 05 22:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* README.ncr53c8xx
	Have to upload release 1.6 for users of linux-1.3.70-71

Mon Mar 04 16:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* README.ncr53c8xx
	Add some Bonnie results to the README file.

Sun Mar 03 20:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Make changes for linux-1.3.70 according to the new specification of
	irq services interface (request_irq(), free_irq()).
	With 26 letters, "_", and 10 digits we can build about:
		53x62**9 C names of 10 characters.
	Why to use SAME function names with DIFFERENT parameters ?

Sat Mar 02 22:30 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Using SIMPLE QUEUE TAG for all operations is good for performances,
	but may be bad for assumed timeout values.
	Under heavy disk load (Bonnie), the drive may start IO process of a 
	command, then disconnect, then execute lots of other commands 
	before completing the interrupted command.
	The standard value of SD_TIMEOUT (6 sec or 7 sec) seems (is) too short.
	I fix the problem by forcing an ORDERED QUEUE TAG for the next  
	command when I found some "old" pending command.
	"Old" means that they might be timeouted in a few seconds.
	Add NCR_TIMEOUT_ALERT and set it to 3 seconds.

Fri Mar 01 22:30 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.h, ncr53c8xx.c
	Add define SCSI_NCR_SEGMENT_SIZE and set it by default to 512.
	If undefined, the driver use the scatter list given by the upper 
	scsi driver, else it tries to split segments into shorter one 
	according to the value of SCSI_NCR_SEGMENT_SIZE.

Tue Feb 27 21:30 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.h
	Set sg_tablesize to 127 = SCSI_NCR_MAX_SCATTER-1.
	(was 64 = SCSI_NCR_MAX_SCATTER/2).
	May increase the speed (about 20%) for linear read/write operations.
	Bonnie results may be better, but I prefered the previous
	value.

Tue Feb 27 21:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr54c8xx.c, ncr53c8xx.h
	Tagged command queueing seems to affect linux-1.3.XY kernels.
	I decide to disable tagged queue by default and to provide a command
	tool to enable it per device after boot-up.
	Add scsitag.c to the distribution.
	Usage: scsitag device
	Examples: scsitag /dev/sda
	          scsitag /dev/sdb

Sun Feb 25 14:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c, ncr53c8xx.h
	Add INQ7_Default definition and set the target capabilities to this
	value by default.
	Add some code to reject a synchronous negotiation request from a target
	that is defined as not capable of Sync in the table of capabilities.
	
Sat Feb 24 23:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Add some code to fill some write-only host instance fields:
	- base
	- io_port
	- n_io_port
	- dma_channel
	This fields may be used with some "standard" drivers that do not 
	process correctly the release function.

Fri Feb 23 23:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	I receive a mail from Jason Duerstock.
	A new bug in ncrBsd2Linux which is probably outside the driver code
	and inside Linux kernel code.
	The kernel memory is quite corrupted and we cannot get any information
	by looking into the messages about the crash. However Linus see a bug in
	ncrBsd2Linux because it is a "non standard" driver.
	I think too that ncrBsd2Linux is not a standard driver of Linux kernel,
	because it has no bugs enough to become standard for Linux.
	Drew's driver is quite standard.

Wed Feb 21 23:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c, ncr53c8xx.h
	I incorporate the differences between FreeBSD ncr.c revision 1.62 and
	revision 1.64.
	- Some cosmetic changes.
	- Use M_SIMPLE_TAG by default (even for write operations).
	  I seems to me that SIMPLE TAG is safe only if the flag "queue
	  algorithm modifier" is set to zero.
	  I will ask some questions to Stefan Esser about this.
	Add option SCSI_NCR_ALWAYS_SIMPLE_TAG in ncr53c8xx.h.

Fri Feb 16 23:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	I have found the bug. It is a recursion in __get_free_pages().
	I will send a mail to Linus about this.

Sat Feb 10 20:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	I am sure that the kernel stack overflow is due to a severe bug in
	the Linux kernel.
	I decide to try to find the bug by myself.

Fri Feb 09 20:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c, ncr53c8xx.h
	Limit commands per lun to 2 for linux-1.3.XY.
	The patch-1.3.60 does not correct the kernel stack overflow problem.
	I decide to make some tests with Drew's driver and Bsd2Linux with same 
	working conditions (3 commands per lun, FAST SCSI, no command queueing).
	I get the stack overflow problem with the 2 drivers at the same 
	frequency.
	With only 2 commands per lun, I dont have the problem with any driver.
	It seems that the madness of recursion and the recent introduction of
	the silly generic read function have broken performance and reliability 
	of scsi drivers.

Thu Feb 08 23:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c, ncr_attach()
	Release memory mapped region and io port if initialisation
	does not succeed.

Thu Feb 08 22:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c, ncr53c8xx.c
	Try to spare some CPU time in queue_command() function and interrupt
	handler:
	Add SCSI_NCR_PARANOIA define option in ncr53c8xx.h.
	Add SCSI_NCR_PROFILE  define option in ncr53c8xx.h.
	Avoid useless code and function calls.

Tue Feb 06 21:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c, ncr53c8xx.h, ncr_timeout()
	Add SCSI_NCR_BROKEN_INTR define option in ncr53c8xx.h.
	If this option is set, the timeout handler polls the interrupt status
	register every tick (10 ms). So, boards with broken interrupt can work. 

Mon Feb 05 21:30 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Print the correct speed, for devices with successfull wide negotiation.
	For same period, such devices are two times faster then narrow ones.

Mon Feb 05 21:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.h, ncr53c8xx.c, ncr_attach()
	Add define SCSI_NCR_SETTLE_TIME in header file and set it by default
	to 2 seconds.

Sat Jan 27 14:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Upload release 1.3

Wed Jan 24 24:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Update from ncr Bsd 1.60 (Stefan Esser):
	The handshake timeout is disabled, since
	a few devices will delay ACK for more than a 
	second: Scanner, CDROM writer and a few old hard 
	disk drives.

Wed Jan 24 22:30 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Set the selection timeout to 0.4 sec, since 0.25 sec
	is recommended for scsi-1 devices.
	Note that the Bsd ncr driver sets this timeout to 0.1 sec
	and the linux standard ncr driver sets it to 0.8 sec.

Wed Jan 24 22:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Add a 5 seconds delay after chip initialization,
	waiting for scsi devices to settle their stomach,
	as FreeBSD generic scsi driver does.

Tue Jan 23 23:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Set burst length value according to chip type.
	The original Bsd ncr driver sets burst length to 16 for
	all chip types.

Tue Jan 16 23:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c, ncr53c8xx.h
	Add comments to linux specific glue code.

Mon Jan 15 22:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	io mapped versus memory mapped.
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Add some code to dynamicaly switch to io mapped if memory mapped
	does not work.
	No more need to reconfigure, compile and link the kernel if
	memory mapped is not possible.

Sun Jan 14 18:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Patch sent to ncr mailing list by Jason Duerstock
	<jduersto@kendall.mdcc.edu>
	I have omitted to provide the proc_dir_entry to the middle
	scsi driver.
	* ncr53c8xxx.c
	Add the declaration of the ncr53c8xx proc_dir_entry and return
	the pointer to middle scsi driver.

Sat Jan 13 01:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	ncrBsd2Linux 1.1 is ready.
	Upload to sunsite immediatly.

Fri Jan 12 23:45 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	It seems that scsi-2 devices too may cause problems because they
	have flawes in the firmware.
	* ncr53c8xx.h
	I add a table of capabilities per target.
	This table contains one byte per target. The value of this byte
	is anded with byte 7 of INQUIRY data.
	Edit ncr53c8xx.h and read the corresponding comments for more
	details.

Wed Jan 10 22:35 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	I have some time to read the scsi-1 specifications.
	Some very old scsi devices may cause problems with the ncr Bsd driver
	for the following raisons:
	    The Synchronous Negotiation protocol was optional.
	    The standardized INQUIRY data does not include the byte 7 of
	    the scsi-2 specifications which contains the capabilities of
	    the device.
	I think that negotiation with such devices are very questionnable.
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	ncrBsd2Linux 1.1 does not negotiate with scsi-1 devices.

Sat Jan 06 21:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c function ncr_attach()
	Disable chip interrupt before soft reset in attach procedure.
	When loadlin is used to boot the system, the state of the NCR chip
	is unpredicable. This modification avoid unexpected interrupts.
	
Thu Jan 04 23:45 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	ncrBsd2Linux 1.0 is ready.
	Upload to sunsite immediatly.

Tue Jan 02 23:00 1996 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Add a waiting list for Scsi Commands than can be inserted
	into the start queue immediatly.
	When a command complete, the waiting commands are requeued by calling
	the queuecommand() function.

Sun Dec 31 23:59 1995 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Use kmalloc()/kfree() for internal data structures allocation to
	avoid scsi memory pool shortage.

Sat Dec 30 23:00 1995 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	ncrBsd2Linux can now use memory mapped IO.
	Works fine.
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	    Call vremap() from ncr_attach() to map the physical page which
	    contains the memory IO window.
	    Call vfree() from ncr_detach() (release module).

	ncrBsd2Linux can now be configured as a module.
	Works fine.
	* ncr53c8xx.c: add new functions ncr53c8xx_release() and ncr_detach()
	Add the code to (per host):
	    Stop the timer.
	    Stop the chip.
	    Free allocated memory.

Fri Dec 29 23:00 1995 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Problem: detection routine returns 0 and can detect only one host.
	* ncr53c8xx.c function ncr_attach()
	ncr_attach() now returns 0 on success and -1 on error.
	ncr53c8xx_detect() returns the number of detected hosts.

Thu Dec 28 22:00 1995 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	I must upload the new version which corrects the severe problem with
	WRITE_10 command.
	Release 0.5
	Known or probable problems with this ncr driver release:
	--------------------------------------------------------
	    Same as the previous release.

Wed Dec 27 23:00 1995 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Problem:
	    System CRASH or scsi ERROR "extra data disgarded" on WRITE(10)
	    command. 
	* ncr53c8xx.c function guess_xfer_direction()
	I add the WRITE(10) (0x2A) into the list of Data Out scsi commands.
	It was a big mistake.
	This BUG was introduced in the release 0.3 and is obvious present in
	the release 0.4.

Wed Dec 27 22:00 1995 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Problem:
	    When I was testing tagged command queueing and disconnections
	    with one hard disk at a time (IBM S12), the script process hung 
	    every 5 minutes with a non empty stall queue.
	* ncr53c8xx.c function ncr_exception()
	I replace "OUTB (nc_istat, INTF)" by
	          "OUTB (nc_istat, (istat & SIGP) | INTF)".
	This statement cleared the INTF condition, but cleared the SIGP flag too.
	(This bug is in the original FreeBSD ncr driver).

Mon Dec 25 22:00 1995 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Release 0.4
	Known or probable problems with this ncr driver release:
	--------------------------------------------------------
	  Hardware (or software) conflicts with some ethernet cards.
	      See release 0.2 above.
	  Crash with Intel saturn chipset with write-back cache enabled.
	      The SCSI SCRIPT access the internal registers of
	      the NCR chip by memory addressing.
              Ensure that the memory area of the NCR chip is not cacheable.
	      Use scanpci to get the base memory address of the ncr chip.
	      The 128 bytes following this address must not be cached.

Sat Dec 23 22:00 1995 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Problem:
		FreeBSD driver important comments
		---------------------------------
		We try to reduce the number of interrupts caused
		by unexpected phase changes due to disconnects.
		A typical harddisk may disconnect before ANY block.
		If we wanted to avoid unexpected phase changes at all
		we had to use a break point every 512 bytes.
		Of course the number of scatter/gather blocks is
		limited.
	* ncr53c8xx.c function ncr_scatter()
	This function has been rewritten according to the above comments.
	The Linux scatter list is scanned, and blocks are broken as possible
	into 512 bytes chunks.

Wed Dec 22 22:00 1995 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Problem: ensure that there are enough allocated Command Control Blocks
	         for each unit to enqueue commands according to cmd_per_lun.
	* ncr53c8xx.c function ncr_allocate_ccb()
	Allocate all required ccb(s) instead of one at a time.

Mon Dec 18 23:00 1995 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Problem: A copy of the system time is used to compute timeouts.
	         When the system time is changed , we can get spurious timeouts
	         if scsi commands are pending.
	* ncr53c8xx.c function ncr_timeout()
	In FreeBSD the kernel time (volatile struct timeval time) is not
	affected by settimeofday() or other change time functions.
	For Linux, I replace "time" by "xtime". But "xtime" is the system time,
	and is affected by change time functions.
	If we detect a change <=-1s or >1s we assume system time has been changed.
	For all active ccb(s), we recompute tlimit.
	We set heartbeat to thistime to prevent spurious chip reset.

Sun Dec 17 23:00 1995 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	Release 0.3.

Sun Dec 17 11:00 1995 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)

	Problem: Linux middle-level scsi driver does not provide the
	direction of transfert in scsi command parameters.
	FreeBSD ncr driver need this information to patch the SCSI script
	for SAVE DATA POINTER and to check actual data transfer direction.
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	I add the function guess_xfer_direction(int opcode) which try to
	guess the transfer direction.
 	Unfortunately my documentation about SCSI-II standard is very old.
	It does not contain PHOTO-CD command specifications.
	I assume input transfer direction, for unknown command. (not perfect)

Wed Dec 15 23:00 1995 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)

	It's time to schedule the release 0.2
	Known or probable problems with this ncr driver release:
	--------------------------------------------------------
	  Scsi tapes do not work.
	  scsi-config-1.5 does not work too.
	  Hardware (or software) conflicts with some ethernet cards.
		The linux native ncr53c810 scsi driver does'not use memory
		mapped IO at all.
		The BSD driver can use memory mapped IO.
		Under Linux, i seems to be difficult (or impossible) to map
		a PCI memory area. So I decide to use normal IO in the code of
		the ported driver.
		However, the SCSI SCRIPT access the internal registers of
		the NCR chip by memory addressing.
		EThernet cards use a memory area to communicate with the system.
		I think that this memory area conflicts with the memory area
		used by the NCR chip.
		The configuration diskette of your ethernet card can help you
		to fix the problem (try sofware configurations).

	Problem: detection of CD change did not work.
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Signal a CHECK_CONDITION (S_CHECK_COND) to the middle-level
	scsi drivers when the scsi completion status = S_SENSE|S_GOOD.

	Problem: System hang with status <4/82> after mounting the root
	         partition. System disk is a QUANTUM EMPIRE 1080 S.
	Submitted by rwilhelm@Physik.TU-Muenchen.DE (Robert Wilhelm)
	Thu, 14 Dec 1995 10:18:43 +0100 (MET)
	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Signal a CHECK_CONDITION (S_CHECK_COND) to the middle-level
	scsi drivers when the scsi completion status = S_SENSE|S_CHECK_COND.
	(HS_COMPLETE=4, S_SENSE|S_CHECK_COND=x82).
	I can't test this fix. I think that it should work.

	Problem	submitted by Bill Dyess <Bill@Dyess.com> Tue 12 Dec 1995
	Only one lun detected on a Pioneer DRM-602X 6-disk CD-ROM changer.
	* ncr53c8xx.h, ncr53c8xx.c
	Define NCR_SCSI_MAX_LUN to 8 if the Linux configuration flag
	SCSI_CONFIG_MULTI_LUN is set.
	My CD device has only one lun. I can't test multi-lun device,
	but I think that it should work.

	* ncr53c8xx.c
	Write the ncr_abort_command() and ncr_reset_command() functions.
	I intend to test these functions next week.

Sun Dec 10 22:00 1995 Gerard Roudier (groudier@club-internet.fr)
	* Release 0.1
	Works fine with hard disks under Linux 1.2.13 and Linux 1.3.45.
