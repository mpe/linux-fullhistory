8.11.1

* Fix for PCVC720/40, would not be able to set videomode
* Fix for Samsung MPC models, appearantly they are based on a newer chipset

8.11

* 20 dev_hints (per request)
* Hot unplugging should be better, no more dangling pointers or memory leaks
* Added reserved Logitech webcam IDs

8.9

* Merging with kernel 2.5.49
* Adding IDs for QuickCam Zoom & QuickCam Notebook

8.8

* Fixing 'leds' parameter
* Adding IDs for Logitech QuickCam Pro 4000
* Making URB init/cleanup a little nicer

8.7

* Incorporating changes in ioctl() parameter passing
* Also changes to URB mechanism

8.6

* Added ID's for Visionite VCS UM100 and UC300
* Removed YUV420-interlaced palette altogether (was confusing)
* Removed MIRROR stuff as it didn't work anyway
* Fixed a problem with the 'leds' parameter (wouldn't blink)
* Added ioctl()s for advanced features: 'extended' whitebalance ioctl()s,
  CONTOUR, BACKLIGHT, FLICKER, DYNNOISE.
* VIDIOCGCAP.name now contains real camera model name instead of
  'Philips xxx webcam'
* Added PROBE ioctl (see previous point & API doc)

8.5

* Adding IDs for Creative Labs Webcam 5
* Adding IDs for SOTEC CMS-001 webcam
* Solving possible hang in VIDIOCSYNC when unplugging the cam 
* Forgot to return structure in VIDIOCPWCGAWB, oops
* Time interval for the LEDs are now in milliseconds

8.4

* Fixing power_save option for Vesta range
* Handling new error codes in ISOC callback
* Adding dev_hint module parameter, to specify /dev/videoX device nodes

8.3

* Adding Samsung C10 and C30 cameras
* Removing palette module parameter
* Fixed typo in ID of QuickCam 3000 Pro
* Adding LED settings (blinking while in use) for ToUCam cameras.
* Turns LED off when camera is not in use.

8.2

* Making module more silent when trace = 0 
* Adding QuickCam 3000 Pro IDs
* Chrominance control for the Vesta cameras
* Hopefully fixed problems on machines with BIGMEM and > 1GB of RAM
* Included Oliver Neukem's lock_kernel() patch
* Allocates less memory for image buffers
* Adds ioctl()s for the whitebalancing

8.1

* Adding support for 750
* Adding V4L GAUDIO/SAUDIO/UNIT ioctl() calls

8.0
* 'damage control' after inclusion in 2.4.5.
* Changed wait-queue mechanism in read/mmap/poll according to the book.
* Included YUV420P palette.
* Changed interface to decompressor module.
* Cleaned up pwc structure a bit.

7.0

* Fixed bug in vcvt_420i_yuyv; extra variables on stack were misaligned.
* There is now a clear error message when an image size is selected that
  is only supported using the decompressor, and the decompressor isn't
  loaded.
* When the decompressor wasn't loaded, selecting large image size
  would create skewed or double images.

6.3

* Introduced spinlocks for the buffer pointer manipulation; a number of
  reports seem to suggest the down()/up() semaphores were the cause of
  lockups, since they are not suitable for interrupt/user locking.
* Separated decompressor and core code into 2 modules.

6.2

* Non-integral image sizes are now padded with gray or black.
* Added SHUTTERSPEED ioctl().
* Fixed buglet in VIDIOCPWCSAGC; the function would always return an error,
  even though the call succeeded.
* Added hotplug support for 2.4.*.
* Memory: the 645/646 uses less memory now.

6.1

* VIDIOCSPICT returns -EINVAL with invalid palettes.
* Added saturation control.
* Split decompressors from rest.
* Fixed bug that would reset the framerate to the default framerate if 
  the rate field was set to 0 (which is not what I intended, nl. do not 
  change the framerate!).
* VIDIOCPWCSCQUAL (setting compression quality) now takes effect immediately.
* Workaround for a bug in the 730 sensor.
