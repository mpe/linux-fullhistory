	  Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a specification for a serial bus
	  subsystem which offers higher speeds and more features than the
	  traditional PC serial port.  The bus supplies power to peripherals
	  and allows for hot swapping.  Up to 127 USB peripherals can be
	  connected to a single USB port in a tree structure.  The USB port is
	  the root of the tree, the peripherals are the leaves and the inner
	  nodes are special USB devices called hubs.  Many newer PC's have USB
	  ports and newer peripherals such as scanners, keyboards, mice,
	  modems, and printers support the USB protocol and can be connected
	  to the PC via those ports.

	  Say Y here if your computer has a USB port and you want to use USB
	  devices.  You then need to say Y to at least one of "UHCI HCD support"
	  or "OHCI HCD support" below (the type of interface that the USB hardware
	  in your computer provides to the operating system) and then choose
	  from amongst the drivers for USB peripherals.  You may want to check
	  out the information provided in <file:Documentation/usb/> and
	  especially the links given in <file:Documentation/usb/usb-help.txt>.

	  If you have a new USB 2.0 High Speed system, you should also choose
	  "EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support" as well as at least one of UHCI or OHCI.

	  It doesn't normally hurt to select them all if you are not certain.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called usbcore.

	depends on USB && PARPORT
	---help---
	  This driver is for USB parallel port adapters that use the Lucent
	  Technologies USS-720 chip. These cables are plugged into your USB
	  port and provide USB compatibility to peripherals designed with
	  parallel port interfaces.

	  The chip has two modes: automatic mode and manual mode. In automatic
	  mode, it looks to the computer like a standard USB printer. Only
	  printers may be connected to the USS-720 in this mode. The generic
	  USB printer driver ("USB Printer support", above) may be used in
	  that mode, and you can say N here if you want to use the chip only
	  in this mode.

	  Manual mode is not limited to printers, any parallel port
	  device should work. This driver utilizes manual mode.
	  Note however that some operations are three orders of magnitude
	  slower than on a PCI/ISA Parallel Port, so timing critical
	  applications might not work.

	  Say Y here if you own an USS-720 USB->Parport cable and intend to
	  connect anything other than a printer to it.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called uss720.
