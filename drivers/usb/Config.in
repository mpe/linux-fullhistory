# NOTE NOTE NOTE! This is still considered extremely experimental.
# Right now hubs, mice and keyboards work - at least with UHCI.
# But that may be more a lucky coincidence than anything else..
#
# This was all developed modularly, but I've been lazy in cleaning
# it up, so right now they are all bools.
