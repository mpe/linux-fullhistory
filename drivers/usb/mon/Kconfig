# USB Monitor configuration
#

# In normal life, it makes little sense to have usbmon as a module, and in fact
# it is harmful, because there is no way to autoload the module.
# The 'm' option is allowed for hackers who debug the usbmon itself,
# and for those who have usbcore as a module.

	  If you say Y here, a component which captures the USB traffic
	  between peripheral-specific drivers and HC drivers will be built.
	  The USB_MON is similar in spirit and may be compatible with Dave
	  Harding's USBMon.

	  This is somewhat experimental at this time, but it should be safe,
	  as long as you aren't building this as a module and then removing it.

	  If unsure, say Y. Do not say M.
