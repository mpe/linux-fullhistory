	depends on HOTPLUG
	---help---
	  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree modules
	  require hotplug firmware loading support, but a module built outside
	  the kernel tree does.

config DEBUG_DRIVER
	 bool "Driver Core verbose debug messages"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the Driver core to produce a bunch of
	  debug messages to the system log. Select this if you are having a
	  problem with the driver core and want to see more of what is
	  going on.

	  If you are unsure about this, say N here.
