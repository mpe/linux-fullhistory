config INPUT_MOUSE
	bool "Mice"
	default y
	depends on INPUT
	help
	  Say Y here, and a list of supported mice will be displayed.
	  This option doesn't affect the kernel.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config MOUSE_PS2
	tristate "PS/2 mouse"
	default y
	depends on INPUT && INPUT_MOUSE
	select SERIO
	select SERIO_I8042 if PC
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have a PS/2 mouse connected to your system. This
	  includes the standard 2 or 3-button PS/2 mouse, as well as PS/2
	  mice with wheels and extra buttons, Microsoft, Logitech or Genius
	  compatible.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called psmouse.

config MOUSE_PS2_SYNAPTICS
	bool "Synaptics TouchPad"
	default n
	depends on INPUT && INPUT_MOUSE && MOUSE_PS2
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have a Synaptics TouchPad connected to your system.
	  This touchpad is found on many modern laptop computers.

	  Note that you also need a user space driver to interpret the data
	  generated by the kernel. A compatible driver for XFree86 is available
	  from http://w1.894.telia.com/~u89404340/touchpad/index.html

	  The gpm program is not yet able to interpret the data from this
	  driver, so if you need to use the touchpad in the console, you have to
	  say N for now.

config MOUSE_SERIAL
	tristate "Serial mouse"
	depends on INPUT && INPUT_MOUSE
	select SERIO
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have a serial (RS-232, COM port) mouse connected
	  to your system. This includes Sun, MouseSystems, Microsoft,
	  Logitech and all other compatible serial mice.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called sermouse.

config MOUSE_INPORT
	tristate "InPort/MS/ATIXL busmouse"
	depends on INPUT && INPUT_MOUSE && ISA
	help
	  Say Y here if you have an InPort, Microsoft or ATI XL busmouse.
	  They are rather rare these days.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called inport.

config MOUSE_ATIXL
	bool "ATI XL variant"
	depends on MOUSE_INPORT
	help
	  Say Y here if your mouse is of the ATI XL variety.

config MOUSE_LOGIBM

	help
	  Say Y here if you have a Logitech busmouse.
	  They are rather rare these days.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called logibm.

config MOUSE_PC110PAD
	tristate "IBM PC110 touchpad"
	depends on INPUT && INPUT_MOUSE && ISA
	help
	  Say Y if you have the IBM PC-110 micro-notebook and want its
	  touchpad supported.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called pc110pad.

config MOUSE_MAPLE
	tristate "Maple bus mouse"
	depends on SH_DREAMCAST && INPUT && INPUT_MOUSE && MAPLE
	help
	  Say Y if you have a DreamCast console and a mouse attached to
	  its Maple bus.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called maplemouse.

config MOUSE_AMIGA
	tristate "Amiga mouse"
	depends on AMIGA && INPUT && INPUT_MOUSE
	help
	  Say Y here if you have an Amiga and want its native mouse
	  supported by the kernel.

	depends on ARCH_ACORN && INPUT && INPUT_MOUSE
	help
	  Say Y here if you have the Acorn RiscPC computer and want its
	  native mouse supported.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rpcmouse.

config MOUSE_PC9800
	tristate "NEC PC-9800 busmouse"
	depends on X86_PC9800 && INPUT && INPUT_MOUSE && ISA
	help
	  Say Y here if you have NEC PC-9801/PC-9821 computer and want its
	  native mouse supported.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
