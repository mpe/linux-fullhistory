config GAMEPORT
	tristate "Gameport support"
	---help---
	  Gameport support is for the standard 15-pin PC gameport. If you
	  have a joystick, gamepad, gameport card, a soundcard with a gameport
	  or anything else that uses the gameport, say Y or M here and also to
	  at least one of the hardware specific drivers.

	  For Ensoniq AudioPCI (ES1370), AudioPCI 97 (ES1371), ESS Solo1,
	  S3 SonicVibes, Trident 4DWave, SiS7018, and ALi 5451 gameport
	  support is provided by the sound drivers, so you won't need any
	  from the below listed modules. You still need to say Y here.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called gameport.
