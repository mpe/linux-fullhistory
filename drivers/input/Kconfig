config INPUT
	tristate "Input devices (needed for keyboard, mouse, ...)"
	default y
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have any input device (mouse, keyboard, tablet,
	  joystick, steering wheel ...) connected to your system and want
	  it to be available to applications. This includes standard PS/2
	  keyboard and mouse.

	  Say N here if you have a headless (no monitor, no keyboard) system.

	  More information is available: <file:Documentation/input/input.txt>

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called input. If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

config INPUT_MOUSEDEV
	tristate "Mouse interface"
	default y
	depends on INPUT
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want your mouse to be accessible as char devices
	  13:32+ - /dev/input/mouseX and 13:63 - /dev/input/mice as an
	  emulated IntelliMouse Explorer PS/2 mouse. That way, all user space
	  programs (includung SVGAlib, GPM and X) will be able to use your
	  mouse.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called mousedev. If you want to compile it as
	  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

config INPUT_MOUSEDEV_PSAUX
	bool "Provide legacy /dev/psaux device"
	default y
	depends on INPUT_MOUSEDEV

config INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_X
	int "Horizontal screen resolution"
	depends on INPUT_MOUSEDEV
	default "1024"
	help
	  If you're using a digitizer, or a graphic tablet, and want to use
	  it as a mouse then the mousedev driver needs to know the X window
	  screen resolution you are using to correctly scale the data. If
	  you're not using a digitizer, this value is ignored.

config INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_Y
	int "Vertical screen resolution"
	depends on INPUT_MOUSEDEV
	default "768"
	help
	  If you're using a digitizer, or a graphic tablet, and want to use
	  it as a mouse then the mousedev driver needs to know the X window
	  screen resolution you are using to correctly scale the data. If
	  you're not using a digitizer, this value is ignored.

config INPUT_JOYDEV
	tristate "Joystick interface"
	depends on INPUT
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want your joystick or gamepad to be
	  accessible as char device 13:0+ - /dev/input/jsX device.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  More information is available: <file:Documentation/input/joystick.txt>

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called joydev. If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

config INPUT_TSDEV
	tristate "Touchscreen interface"
	depends on INPUT
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have an application that only can understand the
	  Compaq touchscreen protocol for absolute pointer data. This is
	  useful namely for embedded configurations.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called tsdev. If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

config INPUT_TSDEV_SCREEN_X
	int "Horizontal screen resolution"
	depends on INPUT_TSDEV
	default "240"

config INPUT_TSDEV_SCREEN_Y
	int "Vertical screen resolution"
	depends on INPUT_TSDEV
	default "320"

config INPUT_EVDEV
	tristate "Event interface"
	depends on INPUT
	help
	  Say Y here if you want your input device events be accessible
	  under char device 13:64+ - /dev/input/eventX in a generic way.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called evdev. If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

config INPUT_EVBUG
	tristate "Event debugging"
	depends on INPUT
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have a problem with the input subsystem and
	  want all events (keypresses, mouse movements), to be output to
	  the system log. While this is useful for debugging, it's also
	  a security threat - your keypresses include your passwords, of
	  course.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
