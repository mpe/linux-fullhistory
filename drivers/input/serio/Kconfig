	default y
	---help---
	  Say Yes here if you have any input device that uses serial I/O to
	  communicate with the system. This includes the
	  		* standard AT keyboard and PS/2 mouse *
	  as well as serial mice, Sun keyboards, some joysticks and 6dof
	  devices and more.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called serio.

	depends on !PARISC
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have a Texas Instruments TravelMate notebook
	  equipped with the ct82c710 chip and want to use a mouse connected
	  to the "QuickPort".

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

config SERIO_PARKBD
	tristate "Parallel port keyboard adapter"
	depends on PARPORT
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you built a simple parallel port adapter to attach
	  an additional AT keyboard, XT keyboard or PS/2 mouse.

	  More information is available: <file:Documentation/input/input.txt>

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

config SERIO_GSCPS2
	tristate "HP GSC PS/2 keyboard and PS/2 mouse controller"
	depends on GSC
	default y
	help
	  This driver provides support for the PS/2 ports on PA-RISC machines
	  over which HP PS/2 keyboards and PS/2 mice may be connected.
	  If you use these devices, you'll need to say Y here.

	  It's safe to enable this driver, so if unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called gscps2.

config SERIO_PCIPS2
	tristate "PCI PS/2 keyboard and PS/2 mouse controller"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a Mobility Docking station with PS/2
	  keyboard and mice ports.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called pcips2.

	  Say Y here if you have SGI O2 workstation and want to use its
	  PS/2 ports.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called maceps2.

config SERIO_LIBPS2
	tristate "PS/2 driver library" if EMBEDDED
	help
	  Say Y here if you are using a driver for device connected
	  to a PS/2 port, such as PS/2 mouse or standard AT keyboard.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called libps2.

config SERIO_RAW
	tristate "Raw access to serio ports"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to have raw access to serio ports, such as
	  AUX ports on i8042 keyboard controller. Each serio port that is
	  bound to this driver will be accessible via a char device with
	  major 10 and dynamically allocated minor. The driver will try
	  allocating minor 1 (that historically corresponds to /dev/psaux)
	  first. To bind this driver to a serio port use sysfs interface:

	      echo -n "serio_raw" > /sys/bus/serio/devices/serioX/driver

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called serio_raw.
