STATUS:

o	The core setup works within limits.
o	The scsi layer seems to almost work. I'm still chasing down the hang
	bug.
o	The block OSM is fairly minimal but does seem to work.
o	LAN OSM works with FDDI and Ethernet cards.

TO DO:

General:
o	Support multiple IOP's and tell them about each other
o	Provide hidden address space if asked
o	Long term message flow control
o	PCI IOP's without interrupts are not supported yet
o	Push FAIL handling into the core
o	DDM control interfaces for module load etc
o	Event handling

Block:
o	Real error handler
o	Multiple major numbers
o	Read ahead and cache handling stuff. Talk to Ingo and people
o	Power management
o	Finish Media changers

SCSI:
o	Find the right way to associate drives/luns/busses

Lan:	Batch mode sends
	Performance tuning
	Event handling

Tape:
o	Anyone seen anything implementing this ?
