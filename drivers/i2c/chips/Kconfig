	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && I2C && I2C_PROC
	help
	  Many modern mainboards have some kind of I2C interface integrated.
	  This is often in the form of a SMBus, or System Management Bus, which
	  is basically the same as I2C but which uses only a subset of the I2C
	  protocol.

	  You will also want the latest user-space utilties: you can find them
	  in the lm_sensors package, which you can download at 
	  http://www.lm-sensors.nu

	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for Analog Devices ADM1021 
	  and ADM1023 sensor chips and clones: Maxim MAX1617 and MAX1617A,
	  Genesys Logic GL523SM, National Semi LM84, TI THMC10,
	  and the XEON processor built-in sensor. This can also 
	  be built as a module which can be inserted and removed while the 
	  kernel is running.

	  The module will be called adm1021.o.

	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for National Semiconductor LM75
	  sensor chips and clones: Dallas Semi DS75 and DS1775, TelCon
	  TCN75, and National Semi LM77. This can also be built as a module
	  which can be inserted and removed while the kernel is running.

	  The module will be called lm75.o.
