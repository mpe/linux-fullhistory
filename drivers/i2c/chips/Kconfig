config SENSORS_ADM1021
	tristate "  Analog Devices ADM1021 and compatibles"
	depends on I2C && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for Analog Devices ADM1021 
	  and ADM1023 sensor chips and clones: Maxim MAX1617 and MAX1617A,
	  Genesys Logic GL523SM, National Semi LM84, TI THMC10,
	  and the XEON processor built-in sensor. This can also 
	  be built as a module which can be inserted and removed while the 
	  kernel is running.

	  The module will be called adm1021.
	  
	  You will also need the latest user-space utilties: you can find them
	  in the lm_sensors package, which you can download at 
	  http://www.lm-sensors.nu

config SENSORS_IT87
	tristate "  National Semiconductors IT87 and compatibles"
	depends on I2C && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  The module will be called it87.

	  You will also need the latest user-space utilties: you can find them
	  in the lm_sensors package, which you can download at 
	  http://www.lm-sensors.nu
