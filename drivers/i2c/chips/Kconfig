	  If you say yes here you get support for Analog Devices ADM1021 
	  and ADM1023 sensor chips and clones: Maxim MAX1617 and MAX1617A,
	  Genesys Logic GL523SM, National Semi LM84, TI THMC10,
	  and the XEON processor built-in sensor. This can also 
	  be built as a module which can be inserted and removed while the 
	  kernel is running.

	  The module will be called adm1021.
	  
	  You will also need the latest user-space utilties: you can find them
	  in the lm_sensors package, which you can download at 
	  http://www.lm-sensors.nu

config SENSORS_LM75
	tristate "  National Semiconductors LM75 and compatibles"
	depends on I2C && I2C_PROC
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for National Semiconductor LM75
	  sensor chips and clones: Dallas Semi DS75 and DS1775, TelCon
	  TCN75, and National Semi LM77. This can also be built as a module
	  which can be inserted and removed while the kernel is running.

	  The module will be called lm75.
