config I2C
	tristate "I2C support"
	---help---
	  I2C (pronounce: I-square-C) is a slow serial bus protocol used in
	  many micro controller applications and developed by Philips.  SMBus,
	  or System Management Bus is a subset of the I2C protocol.  More
	  information is contained in the directory <file:Documentation/i2c/>,
	  especially in the file called "summary" there.

	  Both I2C and SMBus are supported here. You will need this for
	  hardware sensors support, and also for Video For Linux support.
	  Specifically, if you want to use a BT848 based frame grabber/overlay
	  boards under Linux, say Y here and also to "I2C bit-banging
	  interfaces", below.

	  If you want I2C support, you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your bus adapter(s) below.

	  This I2C support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-core.

config I2C_CHARDEV
	tristate "I2C device interface"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  Say Y here to use i2c-* device files, usually found in the /dev
	  directory on your system.  They make it possible to have user-space
	  programs use the I2C bus.  Information on how to do this is
	  contained in the file <file:Documentation/i2c/dev-interface>.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called i2c-dev.

config I2C_ALGOBIT
	tristate "I2C bit-banging interfaces"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  This allows you to use a range of I2C adapters called bit-banging
	  adapters.  Say Y if you own an I2C adapter belonging to this class
	  and then say Y to the specific driver for you adapter below.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called i2c-algo-bit.

config I2C_ALGOPCF
	tristate "I2C PCF 8584 interfaces"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  This allows you to use a range of I2C adapters called PCF adapters.
	  Say Y if you own an I2C adapter belonging to this class and then say
	  Y to the specific driver for you adapter below.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called i2c-algo-pcf.

config I2C_ALGOITE
	tristate "ITE I2C Algorithm"
	depends on MIPS_ITE8172 && I2C
	help
	  This supports the use of the ITE8172 I2C interface found on some MIPS
	  systems. Say Y if you have one of these. You should also say Y for
	  the ITE I2C peripheral driver support below.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called i2c-algo-ite.

config I2C_ALGO8XX
	tristate "MPC8xx CPM I2C interface"
	depends on 8xx && I2C
