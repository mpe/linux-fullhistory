config I2C
	tristate "I2C support"
	---help---
	  I2C (pronounce: I-square-C) is a slow serial bus protocol used in
	  many micro controller applications and developed by Philips.  SMBus,
	  or System Management Bus is a subset of the I2C protocol.  More
	  information is contained in the directory <file:Documentation/i2c/>,
	  especially in the file called "summary" there.

	  Both I2C and SMBus are supported here. You will need this for
	  hardware sensors support, and also for Video For Linux support.
	  Specifically, if you want to use a BT848 based frame grabber/overlay
	  boards under Linux, say Y here and also to "I2C bit-banging
	  interfaces", below.

	  If you want I2C support, you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your bus adapter(s) below.  If you say Y to
	  "/proc file system" below, you will then get a /proc interface which
	  is documented in <file:Documentation/i2c/proc-interface>.

	  This I2C support is also available as a module.  If you want to
	  compile it as a module, say M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
	  The module will be called i2c-core.

config I2C_ALGOBIT
	tristate "I2C bit-banging interfaces"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  This allows you to use a range of I2C adapters called bit-banging
	  adapters.  Say Y if you own an I2C adapter belonging to this class
	  and then say Y to the specific driver for you adapter below.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If you want to compile
	  it as a module, say M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
	  The module will be called i2c-algo-bit.

config I2C_PROSAVAGE
	tristate "S3/VIA (Pro)Savage"
	depends on I2C_ALGOBIT && PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  I2C bus and DDC bus of the S3VIA embedded Savage4 and ProSavage8
	  graphics processors.
	  chipsets supported:
	    S3/VIA KM266/VT8375 aka ProSavage8
	    S3/VIA KM133/VT8365 aka Savage4

	  This can also be built as a module which can be inserted and removed
	  while the kernel is running.  If you want to compile it as a module,
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
	  The module will be called i2c-prosavage.

	  You will also need the latest user-space utilties: you can find them
	  in the lm_sensors package, which you can download at
	  http://www.lm-sensors.nu
