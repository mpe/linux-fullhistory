config I2C_ALI1535
	tristate "  ALI 1535"
	depends on I2C && PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the SMB
	  Host controller on Acer Labs Inc. (ALI) M1535 South Bridges.  The SMB
	  controller is part of the 7101 device, which is an ACPI-compliant
	  Power Management Unit (PMU).

	  This can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be
	  called i2c-ali1535.

	  You will also need the latest user-space utilties: you can find them
	  in the lm_sensors package, which you can download at
	  http://www.lm-sensors.nu
