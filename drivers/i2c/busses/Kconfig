config I2C_ALI15X3
	tristate "  ALI 15x3"
	depends on I2C && PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  Acer Labs Inc. (ALI) M1514 and M1543 motherboard I2C interfaces.

	  This can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be
	  called i2c-ali15x3.

	  You will also need the latest user-space utilties: you can find them
	  in the lm_sensors package, which you can download at
	  http://www.lm-sensors.nu

config I2C_AMD756
	tristate "  AMD 756/766"
	depends on I2C && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the AMD
	  756/766/768 mainboard I2C interfaces.

	  This can also be built as a module which can be inserted and removed 
	  while the kernel is running.  If you want to compile it as a module,
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  The module will be called i2c-amd756.

	  You will also need the latest user-space utilties: you can find them
	  in the lm_sensors package, which you can download at 
	  http://www.lm-sensors.nu

	depends on I2C && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the AMD
	  8111 mainboard I2C interfaces.

	  This can also be built as a module which can be inserted and removed 
	  while the kernel is running.  If you want to compile it as a module,
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  The module will be called i2c-amd8111.

	depends on I2C && PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the Intel
	  801 family of mainboard I2C interfaces.  Specifically, the following
	  versions of the chipset is supported:
	    82801AA
	    82801AB
	    82801BA
	    82801CA/CAM
	    82801DB

	  This can also be built as a module which can be inserted and removed 
	  while the kernel is running.  If you want to compile it as a module,
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  The module will be called i2c-i801.

	  You will also need the latest user-space utilties: you can find them

	tristate "  ISA Bus support"
	depends on I2C && ISA && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for i2c
	  interfaces that are on the ISA bus.

	  This can also be built as a module which can be inserted and removed 
	  while the kernel is running.  If you want to compile it as a module,

	tristate "  Intel PIIX4"
	depends on I2C && PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the Intel
	  PIIX4 family of mainboard I2C interfaces.  Specifically, the following
	  versions of the chipset is supported:
	    Intel PIIX4
	    Intel 440MX
	    Serverworks OSB4
	    Serverworks CSB5
	    SMSC Victory66

	  This can also be built as a module which can be inserted and removed 
	  while the kernel is running.  If you want to compile it as a module,
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  The module will be called i2c-piix4.
