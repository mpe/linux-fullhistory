Currently known (or at least suspected) bugs in parport:

o /proc/parport is untested under 2.0.XX

o SCSI aborts for PPA under 2.0.29 [reported by jmr].  Under investigation.

o make config (etc) allow you to select CONFIG_PNP_PARPORT=m, CONFIG_PPA=y -
  the resulting kernel won't link.

o IEEE1284 code does not do the terminating handshake after transfers, which
  seems to upset some devices.

o lp doesn't allow you to read status while printing is in progress.
