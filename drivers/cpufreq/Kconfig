config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of 
	  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because 
	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
	  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
	  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	  Say Y here to enable CPUfreq subsystem (including drivers)
	  debugging. You will need to activate it via the kernel
	  command line by passing
	     cpufreq.debug=<value>

	  To get <value>, add 
	       1 to activate CPUfreq core debugging,
	       2 to activate CPUfreq drivers debugging, and
	       4 to activate CPUfreq governor debugging

	  Use the CPUFreq governor 'performance' as default. This sets
	  the frequency statically to the highest frequency supported by
	  the CPU.

	  to enable the userspace governor manually.

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_ONDEMAND
	tristate "'ondemand' cpufreq policy governor"
	help
	  'ondemand' - This driver adds a dynamic cpufreq policy governor.
	  The governor does a periodic polling and 
	  changes frequency based on the CPU utilization.
	  The support for this governor depends on CPU capability to
	  do fast frequency switching (i.e, very low latency frequency
	  transitions). 

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpu-freq.

	  If in doubt, say N.
