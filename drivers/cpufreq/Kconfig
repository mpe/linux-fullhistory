config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of 
	  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because 
	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
	  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
	  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_DEBUG
	bool "Enable CPUfreq debugging"
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	help
	  Say Y here to enable CPUfreq subsystem (including drivers)
	  debugging. You will need to activate it via the kernel
	  command line by passing
	     cpufreq.debug=<value>

	  To get <value>, add 
	       1 to activate CPUfreq core debugging,
	       2 to activate CPUfreq drivers debugging, and
	       4 to activate CPUfreq governor debugging

config CPU_FREQ_PROC_INTF
	tristate "/proc/cpufreq interface (deprecated)"
	depends on CPU_FREQ && PROC_FS
	help
	  This enables the /proc/cpufreq interface for controlling
	  CPUFreq. Please note that it is recommended to use the sysfs
	  interface instead (which is built automatically). 
	  
	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.
	  
	  If in doubt, say N.

	  This option sets which CPUFreq governor shall be loaded at
	  startup. If in doubt, select 'performance'.

config CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE
	bool "performance"
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_PERFORMANCE
	help
	  Use the CPUFreq governor 'performance' as default. This sets
	  the frequency statically to the highest frequency supported by
	  the CPU.

config CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_USERSPACE
	bool "userspace"
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_USERSPACE
	help
	  Use the CPUFreq governor 'userspace' as default. This allows
	  you to set the CPU frequency manually or when an userspace 
	  program shall be able to set the CPU dynamically without having
	  to enable the userspace governor manually.

	  This cpufreq governor sets the frequency statically to the
	  highest available CPU frequency.

	  If in doubt, say Y.

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_POWERSAVE

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_USERSPACE

       depends on CPU_FREQ 
       help
	  Enable this cpufreq governor when you either want to set the
	  CPU frequency manually or when an userspace program shall
	  be able to set the CPU dynamically, like on LART 
	  <http://www.lart.tudelft.nl/>

config CPU_FREQ_24_API

	depends on SYSCTL
	help
	  This enables the /proc/sys/cpu/ sysctl interface for controlling
	  the CPUFreq,"userspace" governor. This is the same interface
	  as known from the 2.4.-kernel patches for CPUFreq, and offers
	  the same functionality as long as "userspace" is the
	  selected governor for the specified CPU.
	
	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_ONDEMAND
	tristate "'ondemand' cpufreq policy governor"
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	help
	  'ondemand' - This driver adds a dynamic cpufreq policy governor.
	  The governor does a periodic polling and 
	  changes frequency based on the CPU utilization.
	  The support for this governor depends on CPU capability to
	  do fast frequency switching (i.e, very low latency frequency
	  transitions). 

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpu-freq.

	  If in doubt, say N.
