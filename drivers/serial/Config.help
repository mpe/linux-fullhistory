CONFIG_SERIAL_8250
  This selects whether you want to include the driver for the standard
  serial ports.  The standard answer is Y.  People who might say N
  here are those that are setting up dedicated Ethernet WWW/FTP
  servers, or users that have one of the various bus mice instead of a
  serial mouse and don't intend to use their machine's standard serial
  port for anything.  (Note that the Cyclades and Stallion multi
  serial port drivers do not need this driver built in for them to
  work.)

  If you want to compile this driver as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  serial.o.
  [WARNING: Do not compile this driver as a module if you are using
  non-standard serial ports, since the configuration information will
  be lost when the driver is unloaded.  This limitation may be lifted
  in the future.]

  BTW1: If you have a mouseman serial mouse which is not recognized by
  the X window system, try running gpm first.

  BTW2: If you intend to use a software modem (also called Winmodem)
  under Linux, forget it.  These modems are crippled and require
  proprietary drivers which are only available under Windows.

  Most people will say Y or M here, so that they can use serial mice,
  modems and similar devices connecting to the standard serial ports.

CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE
  If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a serial port as the
  system console (the system console is the device which receives all
  kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user
  mode). This could be useful if some terminal or printer is connected
  to that serial port.

  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
  "console=ttyS1". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
  kernel at boot time.)

  If you don't have a VGA card installed and you say Y here, the
  kernel will automatically use the first serial line, /dev/ttyS0, as
  system console.

  If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CS
  Say Y here to enable support for 16-bit PCMCIA serial devices,
  including serial port cards, modems, and the modem functions of
  multi-function Ethernet/modem cards. (PCMCIA- or PC-cards are
  credit-card size devices often used with laptops.)

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called serial_cs.o.  If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
  If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_EXTENDED
  If you wish to use any non-standard features of the standard "dumb"
  driver, say Y here. This includes HUB6 support, shared serial
  interrupts, special multiport support, support for more than the
  four COM 1/2/3/4 boards, etc.

  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about serial driver options. If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_MANY_PORTS
  Say Y here if you have dumb serial boards other than the four
  standard COM 1/2/3/4 ports. This may happen if you have an AST
  FourPort, Accent Async, Boca (read the Boca mini-HOWTO, available
  from <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>), or other custom
  serial port hardware which acts similar to standard serial port
  hardware. If you only use the standard COM 1/2/3/4 ports, you can
  say N here to save some memory. You can also say Y if you have an
  "intelligent" multiport card such as Cyclades, Digiboards, etc.

CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_SHARE_IRQ
  Some serial boards have hardware support which allows multiple dumb
  serial ports on the same board to share a single IRQ. To enable
  support for this in the serial driver, say Y here.

CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_DETECT_IRQ
  Say Y here if you want the kernel to try to guess which IRQ
  to use for your serial port.

  This is considered unsafe; it is far better to configure the IRQ in
  a boot script using the setserial command.

  If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_MULTIPORT
  Some multiport serial ports have special ports which are used to
  signal when there are any serial ports on the board which need
  servicing. Say Y here to enable the serial driver to take advantage
  of those special I/O ports.

CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_RSA
  ::: To be written :::

CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_ACORN
  If you have an Atomwide Serial card or Serial Port card for an Acorn
  system, say Y to this option.  The driver can handle 1, 2, or 3 port
  cards.  If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_SERIAL_ANAKIN
  ::: To be written :::

CONFIG_SERIAL_ANAKIN_CONSOLE
  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
  "console=ttyAN0". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
  kernel at boot time.)

CONFIG_ANAKIN_DEFAULT_BAUDRATE
  ::: To be written :::

CONFIG_SERIAL_AMBA
  This selects the ARM(R) AMBA(R) PrimeCell UART.  If you have an
  Integrator platform, say Y or M here.

  If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_SERIAL_AMBA_CONSOLE
  Say Y here if you wish to use an AMBA PrimeCell UART as the system
  console (the system console is the device which receives all kernel
  messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode).

  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible framebuffer console
  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
  "console=ttyAM0". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
  kernel at boot time.)

CONFIG_SERIAL_CLPS711X
  ::: To be written :::

CONFIG_SERIAL_CLPS711X_CONSOLE
  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
  "console=ttyCL1". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
  kernel at boot time.)

CONFIG_SERIAL_CLPS711X_OLD_NAME
  ::: To be written :::

CONFIG_SERIAL_21285
  If you have a machine based on a 21285 (Footbridge) StrongARM(R)/
  PCI bridge you can enable its onboard serial port by enabling this
  option.

CONFIG_SERIAL_21285_OLD
  Use the old /dev/ttyS name, major 4 minor 64.  This is obsolete
  and will be removed during later 2.5 development.

CONFIG_SERIAL_21285_CONSOLE
  If you have enabled the serial port on the 21285 footbridge you can
  make it the console by answering Y to this option.

  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
  "console=ttyFB". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
  kernel at boot time.)

CONFIG_SERIAL_UART00
  Say Y here if you want to use the hard logic uart on Excalibur. This
  driver also supports soft logic implentations of this uart core.

CONFIG_SERIAL_UART00_CONSOLE
  Say Y here if you want to support a serial console on an Excalibur
  hard logic uart or uart00 IP core.

  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
  "console=ttyS1". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
  kernel at boot time.)

CONFIG_SERIAL_SA1100
  If you have a machine based on a SA1100/SA1110 StrongARM(R) CPU you
  can enable its onboard serial port by enabling this option.

  info.

CONFIG_SERIAL_SA1100_CONSOLE
  If you have enabled the serial port on the SA1100/SA1110 StrongARM
  CPU you can make it the console by answering Y to this option.

  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
  "console=ttySA0". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
  kernel at boot time.)
