config NET_TULIP
	bool "\"Tulip\" family network device support"
	help
	  This selects the "Tulip" family of EISA/PCI network cards.

config DE2104X
	tristate "Early DECchip Tulip (dc2104x) PCI support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on NET_TULIP && PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This driver is developed for the SMC EtherPower series Ethernet
	  cards and also works with cards based on the DECchip
	  21040 (Tulip series) chips.  Some LinkSys PCI cards are
	  of this type.  (If your card is NOT SMC EtherPower 10/100 PCI
	  (smc9332dst), you can also try the driver for "Generic DECchip"
	  cards, above.  However, most people with a network card of this type
	  will say Y here.) Do read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  More specific
	  information is contained in
	  <file:Documentation/DocBook/tulip-user.tmpl>.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called tulip.  If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well
	  as <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.

config TULIP_MWI
	bool "New bus configuration (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on TULIP && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This configures your Tulip card specifically for the card and
	  system cache line size type you are using.

	  This is experimental code, not yet tested on many boards.

	  If unsure, say N.

config TULIP_MMIO
	bool "Use PCI shared mem for NIC registers"
	depends on TULIP
	help
	  Use PCI shared memory for the NIC registers, rather than going through
	  the Tulip's PIO (programmed I/O ports).  Faster, but could produce
	  obscure bugs if your mainboard has memory controller timing issues.
	  If in doubt, say N.

config DE4X5
	tristate "Generic DECchip & DIGITAL EtherWORKS PCI/EISA"
	depends on NET_TULIP && (PCI || EISA)
	---help---
	  This is support for the DIGITAL series of PCI/EISA Ethernet cards.
	  These include the DE425, DE434, DE435, DE450 and DE500 models.  If
	  you have a network card of this type, say Y and read the
	  Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. More specific
	  information is contained in
	  <file:Documentation/networking/de4x5.txt>.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called de4x5.  If you want to compile it as a

config WINBOND_840
	tristate "Winbond W89c840 Ethernet support"
	depends on NET_TULIP && PCI
	help
	  This driver is for the Winbond W89c840 chip.  It also works with 
	  the TX9882 chip on the Compex RL100-ATX board.
	  More specific information and updates are available from
	  <http://www.scyld.com/network/drivers.html>.

config DM9102
	tristate "Davicom DM910x/DM980x support"
	depends on NET_TULIP && PCI
	---help---
	  This driver is for DM9102(A)/DM9132/DM9801 compatible PCI cards from
	  Davicom (<http://www.davicom.com.tw/>).  If you have such a network
	  (Ethernet) card, say Y.  Some information is contained in the file
	  <file:Documentation/networking/dmfe.txt>.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called dmfe.  If you want to compile it as a

config PCMCIA_XIRCOM
	tristate "Xircom CardBus support (new driver)"
	depends on NET_TULIP && CARDBUS
	---help---
	  This driver is for the Digital "Tulip" Ethernet CardBus adapters.
	  It should work with most DEC 21*4*-based chips/ethercards, as well
	  as with work-alike chips from Lite-On (PNIC) and Macronix (MXIC) and
	  ASIX.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called xircom_cb.  If you want to compile
	  it as a module, say M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. If unsure, say N.

config PCMCIA_XIRTULIP
	tristate "Xircom Tulip-like CardBus support (old driver)"
	depends on NET_TULIP && CARDBUS
	---help---
	  This driver is for the Digital "Tulip" Ethernet CardBus adapters.
