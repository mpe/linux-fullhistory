#
# This file is used for selecting non-standard netcard options, and
# need not be modified for typical use.
#
# Drivers are *not* selected in this file, but rather with files
# automatically generated during the top-level kernel configuration.
#
# Special options supported, indexed by their 'config' name:
#
#  CONFIG_WD80x3	The Western Digital (SMC) WD80x3 driver
#	WD_SHMEM=xxx	Forces the address of the shared memory
#	WD_no_mapout	Don't map out the shared memory (faster, but
#			your machine may not warm-boot).
#  CONFIG_NE2000	The NE-[12]000 clone driver.
#	PACKETBUF_MEMSIZE  Allows an extra-large packet buffer to be
#			used.  Usually pointless under Linux.
#	show_all_SAPROM  Show the entire address PROM, not just the
#			ethernet address, during boot.
#	rw_bugfix	Patch an obscure bug with a version of the 8390.
#  CONFIG_HPLAN		The HP-LAN driver (for 8390-based boards only).
#	rw_bugfix	Fix the same obscure bug.
#  CONFIG_EL2		The 3c503 EtherLink II driver
#	EL2_AUI		Default to the AUI port instead of the BNC port
#	no_probe_nonshared_memory  Don't probe for programmed-I/O boards.
#	EL2MEMTEST	Test shared memory at boot-time.
#  CONFIG_PLIP		The Crynwr-protocol PL/IP driver
#	INITIALTIMEOUTFACTOR	Timing parameters.
#	MAXTIMEOUTFACTOR
#  DE600		The D-Link DE-600 Portable Ethernet Adaptor.
#	  DE600_IO	The DE600 I/O-port address (0x378 == default)
#	  DE600_IRQ	The DE600 IRQ number to use (IRQ7 == default)
#	  DE600_DEBUG	Enable or disable DE600 debugging (default off)
#  DE620		The D-Link DE-600 Portable Ethernet Adaptor.
#	  DE620_IO	The DE620 I/O-port address (0x378 == default)
#	  DE620_IRQ	The DE620 IRQ number to use (IRQ7 == default)
#	  DE620_DEBUG	Enable or disable DE600 debugging (default off)
#  DEPCA		The DIGITAL series of LANCE based Ethernet Cards
#			(DEPCA, DE100, DE200/1/2, DE210, DE422 (EISA))
#  EWRK3		The DIGITAL series of AT Ethernet Cards (DE203/4/5)
#       EWRK3_DEBUG	Set the desired debug level
#
#  DE4x5		The DIGITAL series of PCI/EISA Ethernet Cards,
#			DE425, DE434 and DE435
#       DE4x5_DEBUG	Set the desired debug level
#	IS_ZYNX         May allow driver to work with Zynx cards - 
#			see linux/drivers/net/README.de4x5
#

# The following options exist, but cannot be set in this file.
#  lance.c
#	LANCE_DMA	Change the default DMA to other than DMA5.
#  8390.c
#	NO_PINGPONG	Disable ping-pong transmit buffers.


# Most drivers also have a *_DEBUG setting that may be adjusted.
# The 8390 drivers share the EI_DEBUG setting.
