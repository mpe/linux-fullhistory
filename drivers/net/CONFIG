#
# This file is used for selecting non-standard netcard options, and
# need not be modified for typical use.
#
# Drivers are *not* selected in this file, but rather with files
# automatically generated during the top-level kernel configuration.
#
# Special options supported, indexed by their 'config' name:
#
#  CONFIG_WD80x3	The Western Digital (SMC) WD80x3 driver
#	WD_SHMEM=xxx	Forces the address of the shared memory
#	WD_no_mapout	Don't map out the shared memory (faster, but
#			your machine may not warm-boot).
#  CONFIG_NE2000	The NE-[12]000 clone driver.
#	PACKETBUF_MEMSIZE  Allows an extra-large packet buffer to be
#			used.  Usually pointless under Linux.
#	show_all_SAPROM  Show the entire address PROM, not just the
#			ethernet address, during boot.
#	rw_bugfix	Patch an obscure bug with a version of the 8390.
#  CONFIG_HPLAN		The HP-LAN driver (for 8390-based boards only).
#	rw_bugfix	Fix the same obscure bug.
#  CONFIG_EL2		The 3c503 EtherLink II driver
#	EL2_AUI		Default to the AUI port instead of the BNC port
#	no_probe_nonshared_memory  Don't probe for programmed-I/O boards.
#	EL2MEMTEST	Test shared memory at boot-time.
#  CONFIG_PLIP		The Crynwr-protocol PL/IP driver
#	INITIALTIMEOUTFACTOR	Timing parameters.
#	MAXTIMEOUTFACTOR
#  D_LINK		The D-Link DE-600 Portable Ethernet Adaptor.
#	  D_LINK_IO	The D-Link I/O address (0x378 == typical)
#	  D_LINK_IRQ	The D-Link IRQ number to use (IRQ7 == typical)
#	  D_LINK_DEBUG	Enable or disable D-Link debugging
#  DEPCA		The DIGITAL series of AT Ethernet Cards (DE100, DE200)
#	  DEPCA_IRQ	Set the desired IRQ (=0, for autoprobe)
#	  DEPCA_DEBUG	Set the desired debug level
#

# The following options exist, but cannot be set in this file.
#  lance.c
#	LANCE_DMA	Change the default DMA to other than DMA5.
#  8390.c
#	NO_PINGPONG	Disable ping-pong transmit buffers.


# Most drivers also have a *_DEBUG setting that may be adjusted.
# The 8390 drivers share the EI_DEBUG settting.

# General options for Space.c
