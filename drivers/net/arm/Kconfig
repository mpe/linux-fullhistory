config ARM_AM79C961A
	bool "ARM EBSA110 AM79C961A support"
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && ARM && ARCH_EBSA110
	select CRC32
	help
	  If you wish to compile a kernel for the EBSA-110, then you should
	  always answer Y to this.

config ARM_ETHER1
	tristate "Acorn Ether1 support"
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && ARM && ARCH_ACORN
	help
	  If you have an Acorn system with one of these (AKA25) network cards,
	  you should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

config ARM_ETHER3
	tristate "Acorn/ANT Ether3 support"
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && ARM && ARCH_ACORN
	help
	  If you have an Acorn system with one of these network cards, you
	  should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

config ARM_ETHERH
	tristate "I-cubed EtherH/ANT EtherM support"
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && ARM && ARCH_ACORN
	select CRC32
	help
	  If you have an Acorn system with one of these network cards, you
	  should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

config ARM_ETHER00
	tristate "Altera Ether00 support"
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && ARM && ARCH_CAMELOT
	help
	  This is the driver for Altera's ether00 ethernet mac IP core. Say
	  Y here if you want to build support for this into the kernel. It
	  is also available as a module (say M here) that can be inserted/
	  removed from the kernel at the same time as the PLD is configured.
	  If this driver is running on an epxa10 development board then it
	  will generate a suitable hw address based on the board serial
	  number (MTD support is required for this). Otherwise you will
	  need to set a suitable hw address using ifconfig.

config SMC91X
	tristate "SMC 91C9x/91C1xxx support"
	select CRC32
	select MII
	depends on ARM
	help
	  This is a driver for SMC's 91x series of Ethernet chipsets,
	  including the SMC91C94 and the SMC91C111. Say Y if you want it
	  compiled into the kernel, and read the file
	  <file:Documentation/networking/smc9.txt>  and the Ethernet-HOWTO,
	  available from  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called smc91x.  If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well
	  as <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.
