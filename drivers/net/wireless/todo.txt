	Wireless Todo
	-------------

1) Bring other kernel Wireless LAN drivers here
	Already done :
	 o hermes.c/orinoco.c	-> Wavelan IEEE driver + Airport driver
	Drivers I have control over :
	 o wavelan.c		-> old Wavelan ISA driver
	 o wavelan_cs.c		-> old Wavelan Pcmcia driver (warning : header)
	 o netwave_cs.c		-> Netwave Pcmcia driver
	Drivers likely to go :
	 o ray_cs.c		-> Raytheon/Aviator driver (maintainer MIA)
	Drivers I have absolutely no control over :
	 o arlan.c		-> old Aironet Arlan 655 (need to ask Elmer)
	 o aironet4500_xxx.c	-> Elmer's Aironet driver (need to ask Elmer)
	 o airo.c/airo_cs.c	-> Ben's Aironet driver (not yet in kernel)
	 o strip.c		-> Metricom's stuff. Not a wlan. Hum...

	ETA : Kernel 2.5.X

2) Bring new Wireless LAN driver not yet in the kernel there
