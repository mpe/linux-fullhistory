 *      layout etc is internal to the driver and described within farsync.c.
 *      Overlap exists in that the values used for some fields within the

 *      this file may not be changed arbitrarily.

/*      What's in a name
 *
 *      The project name for this driver is Oscar. The driver is intended to be
 *      used with the FarSite T-Series cards (T2P & T4P) running in the high
 *      speed frame shifter mode. This is sometimes referred to as X.21 mode
 *      which is a complete misnomer as the card continues to support V.24 and
 *      V.35 as well as X.21.
 *
 *      A short common prefix is useful for routines within the driver to avoid
 *      conflict with other similar drivers and I chosen to use "fst_" for this
 *      purpose (FarSite T-series).
 *
 *      Finally the device driver needs a short network interface name. Since
 *      "hdlc" is already in use I've chosen the even less informative "sync"
 *      for the present.
