config WAN
	bool "Wan interfaces support"
	---help---
	  Wide Area Networks (WANs), such as X.25, frame relay and leased
	  lines, are used to interconnect Local Area Networks (LANs) over vast
	  distances with data transfer rates significantly higher than those
	  achievable with commonly used asynchronous modem connections.
	  Usually, a quite expensive external device called a `WAN router' is
	  needed to connect to a WAN.

	  As an alternative, a relatively inexpensive WAN interface card can
	  allow your Linux box to directly connect to a WAN. If you have one
	  of those cards and wish to use it under Linux, say Y here and also
	  to the WAN driver for your card, below.

	  If unsure, say N.

config COSA

	  This is a driver for COSA and SRP synchronous serial boards. These
	  boards allow to connect synchronous serial devices (for example
	  base-band modems, or any other device with the X.21, V.24, V.35 or
	  V.36 interface) to your Linux box. The cards can work as the
	  character device, synchronous PPP network device, or the Cisco HDLC
	  network device.

	  To actually use the COSA or SRP board, you will need user-space
	  utilities for downloading the firmware to the cards and to set them
	  up. Look at the <http://www.fi.muni.cz/~kas/cosa/> for more
	  information about the cards (including the pointer to the user-space

	---help---
	  This is a driver for ISA SBNI12-xx cards which are low cost
	  alternatives to leased line modems. Say Y if you want to insert
	  the driver into the kernel or say M to compile it as a module (the
	  module will be called sbni).

	  You can find more information and last versions of drivers and
	  utilities at <http://www.granch.ru/>. If you have any question you
	  can send email to sbni@granch.ru.

	  Say N if unsure.

config SBNI_MULTILINE
	bool "Multiple line feature support"
	depends on SBNI
	help
	  Schedule traffic for some parallel lines, via SBNI12 adapters.
	  If you have two computers connected with two parallel lines it's
	  possible to increase transfer rate nearly twice. You should have
	  a program named 'sbniconfig' to configure adapters.

	  Say N if unsure.
