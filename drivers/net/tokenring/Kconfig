	  Token Ring is IBM's way of communication on a local network; the
	  rest of the world uses Ethernet. To participate on a Token Ring
	  network, you need a special Token ring network card. If you are
	  connected to such a Token Ring network and want to use your Token
	  Ring card under Linux, say Y here and to the driver for your
	  particular card below and read the Token-Ring mini-HOWTO, available
	  from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. Most people can
	  say N here.

config IBMTR
	tristate "IBM Tropic chipset based adapter support"
	depends on TR && (ISA || MCA)
	---help---
	  This is support for all IBM Token Ring cards that don't use DMA. If
	  you have such a beast, say Y and read the Token-Ring mini-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Warning: this driver will almost definitely fail if more than one
	  active Token Ring card is present.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called ibmtr. If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

config IBMOL
	tristate "IBM Olympic chipset PCI adapter support"
	depends on TR && PCI
	---help---
	  This is support for all non-Lanstreamer IBM PCI Token Ring Cards.
	  Specifically this is all IBM PCI, PCI Wake On Lan, PCI II, PCI II
	  Wake On Lan, and PCI 100/16/4 adapters.

	  If you have such an adapter, say Y and read the Token-Ring
	  mini-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).

	---help---
	  This is support for the 3Com PCI Velocity XL cards, specifically
	  the 3Com 3C359, please note this is not for the 3C339 cards, you
	  should use the tms380 driver instead.

	  If you have such an adapter, say Y and read the Token-Ring
	  mini-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
