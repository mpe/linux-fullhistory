config HOTPLUG_PCI
	tristate "Support for PCI Hotplug (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have a motherboard with a PCI Hotplug controller.
	  This allows you to add and remove PCI cards while the machine is
	  powered up and running.  The file system pcihpfs must be mounted
	  in order to interact with any PCI Hotplug controllers.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called pci_hotplug.o. If you want to compile it
	  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  When in doubt, say N.

config HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ
	tristate "Compaq PCI Hotplug driver"
	depends on HOTPLUG_PCI && X86
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a motherboard with a Compaq PCI Hotplug
	  controller.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called cpqphp.o. If you want to compile it
	  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  When in doubt, say N.

config HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ_NVRAM
	bool "Save configuration into NVRAM on Compaq servers"
	depends on HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a Compaq server that has a PCI Hotplug
	  controller.  This will allow the PCI Hotplug driver to store the PCI
	  system configuration options in NVRAM.

	  When in doubt, say N.

config HOTPLUG_PCI_IBM
	tristate "IBM PCI Hotplug driver"
	depends on HOTPLUG_PCI && X86_IO_APIC && X86
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a motherboard with a IBM PCI Hotplug
	  controller.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be

config HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI
	tristate "ACPI PCI Hotplug driver"
	depends on ACPI && HOTPLUG_PCI
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a system that supports PCI Hotplug using
	  ACPI.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called acpiphp.o. If you want to compile it
