config EISA_PCI_EISA
	bool "Generic PCI/EISA bridge"
	depends on PCI && EISA
	default y
	---help---
	  Activate this option if your system contains a PCI to EISA
	  bridge. If your system have both PCI and EISA slots, you
	  certainly need this option.

	  When in doubt, say Y.

config EISA_VIRTUAL_ROOT
	bool "EISA virtual root device"
	depends on EISA
	default y
	---help---
	  Activate this option if your system only have EISA bus
	  (no PCI slots). The Alpha Jensen is an example of such
	  a system.

	  When in doubt, say Y.

config EISA_NAMES
	bool "EISA device name database"
	depends on EISA
	default y
	---help---
	  By default, the kernel contains a database of all known EISA
	  device names to make the information in sysfs comprehensible
	  to the user. This database increases size of the kernel
	  image by about 40KB, but it gets freed after the system
	  boots up, so it doesn't take up kernel memory. Anyway, if
	  you are building an installation floppy or kernel for an
	  embedded system where kernel image size really matters, you
	  can disable this feature and you'll get device ID instead of
	  names.

	  When in doubt, say Y.
