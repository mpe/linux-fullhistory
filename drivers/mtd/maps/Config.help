  Express, Inc (ITE) QED-4N-S01B eval board and the Globespan IVR
  Reference Board. It provides the necessary addressing, length,
  buswidth, vpp code and addition setup of the flash device for
  these boards. In addition, this mapping driver can be used for
  other boards via setting of the CONFIG_MTD_CSTM_MIPS_IXX_START/
  LEN/BUSWIDTH parameters. This mapping will provide one mtd device
  using one partition. The start address can be offset from the
  beginning of flash and the len can be less than the total flash
  device size to allow a window into the flash. Both CFI and JEDEC
  probes are called.

CONFIG_MTD_CSTM_MIPS_IXX_START
