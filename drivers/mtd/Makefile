# Makefile for the memory technology device drivers.

# Note! Dependencies are done automagically by 'make dep', which also
# removes any old dependencies. DON'T put your own dependencies here
# unless it's something special (ie not a .c file).
#
# Note 2! The CFLAGS definitions are now inherited from the
# parent makes..

#                       *** BIG UGLY NOTE ***
#
# The shiny new inter_module_xxx has introduced yet another ugly link
# order dependency, which I'd previously taken great care to avoid.
# We now have to ensure that the chip drivers are initialised before the
# map drivers, and that the doc200[01] drivers are initialised before
# docprobe.
#
# We'll hopefully merge the doc200[01] drivers and docprobe back into
# a single driver some time soon, but the CFI drivers are going to have
# to stay like that.
#
# Urgh.
