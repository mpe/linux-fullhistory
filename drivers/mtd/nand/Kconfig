config MTD_NAND
	tristate "NAND Device Support"
	depends on MTD
	help
	  This enables support for accessing all type of NAND flash
	  devices with an 8-bit data bus interface. For further 
	  information see www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/tech/nand.html.

config MTD_NAND_VERIFY_WRITE
	bool "Verify NAND page writes"
	depends on MTD_NAND
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
	  NAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
	  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentaly due to device wear or something else.

config MTD_NAND_AUTCPU12
	tristate "SmartMediaCard on autronix autcpu12 board"
	depends on ARM && MTD_NAND && ARCH_AUTCPU12
	help
	  This enables the driver for the autronix autcpu12 board to 
	  access the SmartMediaCard.

config MTD_NAND_EDB7312
	tristate "Support for Cirrus Logic EBD7312 evaluation board"
	depends on ARM && MTD_NAND && ARCH_EDB7312
	help
	  This enables the driver for the Cirrus Logic EBD7312 evaluation 
	  board to access the onboard NAND Flash.

config MTD_NAND_SPIA
	tristate "NAND Flash device on SPIA board"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_P720T && MTD_NAND
	help
	  If you had to ask, you don't have one. Say 'N'.
