# Makefile for the linux adfs filesystem routines.

# Note! Dependencies are done automagically by 'make dep', which also
# removes any old dependencies. DON'T put your own dependencies here
# unless it's something special (not a .c file).
#
# Note 2! The CFLAGS definitions are now in the main makefile.
