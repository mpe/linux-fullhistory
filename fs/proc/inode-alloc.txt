Current inode allocations in the proc-fs (hex-numbers):

  00000000		reserved
  00000001-00000fff	static entries	(goners)
       001		root-ino
       100		scsi/*
       ...
       fff		end

  00001000-00001fff	dynamic entries
  00002000-00002fff	openprom entries
  0001xxxx-7fffxxxx	pid-dir entries for pid 1-7fff
  80000000-ffffffff	unused

Goals:
	a) the only static inumber that will stay is root's.
	b) scsi should go dynamic.
	c) once we'll split the thing into several virtual filesystems we
	will get rid of magical ranges (and this file, BTW).
