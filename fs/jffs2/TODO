 - disable compression in commit_write()?
 - fine-tune the allocation / GC thresholds
 - chattr support - turning on/off and tuning compression per-inode
 - checkpointing (do we need this? scan is quite fast)
 - make the scan code populate real inodes so read_inode just after 
	mount doesn't have to read the flash twice for large files.
	Make this a per-inode option, changable with chattr, so you can
	decide which inodes should be in-core immediately after mount.
 - test, test, test

 - NAND flash support:
	- flush_wbuf using GC to fill it, don't just pad.
	- Deal with write errors. Data don't get lost - we just have to write 
	  the affected node(s) out again somewhere else.
	- make fsync flush only if actually required
	- make sys_sync() work.
	- reboot notifier
	- timed flush of old wbuf
	- fix magical second arg of jffs2_flush_wbuf(). Split into two or more functions instead.


 - Optimisations:
   - Stop GC from decompressing and immediately recompressing nodes which could
     just be copied intact.
   - Furthermore, in the case where it could be copied intact we don't even need
     to call iget() for it -- if we use (raw_node_raw->flash_offset & 2) as a flag
     to show a node can be copied intact and it's _not_ in icache, we could just do
     it, fix up the next_in_ino list and move on. We would need a way to find out
     _whether_ it's in icache though -- if it's in icache we also need to do the 
     fragment lists, etc. P'raps a flag or pointer in the jffs2_inode_cache could
     help.
   - Stop keeping name in-core with struct jffs2_full_dirent. If we keep the hash in 
     the full dirent, we only need to go to the flash in lookup() when we think we've
     got a match, and in readdir(). 
   - Doubly-linked next_in_ino list to allow us to free obsoleted raw_node_refs immediately?
   - Remove totlen from jffs2_raw_node_ref? Need to have totlen passed into
	jffs2_mark_node_obsolete(). Can all callers work it out?
   - Don't check data CRC on node scan during mount. We don't really need to know 
	yet. This means we can't build up node fragment lists, and hence can't 
	build accurate clean/dirty information. But we don't _need_ that for reading,
	only for writing. And in fact we don't even need it for writing until we 
	start to need GC.
