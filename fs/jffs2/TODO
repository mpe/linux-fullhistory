 - Locking audit. Even more so now 2.5 took away the BKL.
 - disable compression in commit_write()?
 - fine-tune the allocation / GC thresholds
 - chattr support - turning on/off and tuning compression per-inode
 - checkpointing (do we need this? scan is quite fast)
 - make the scan code populate real inodes so read_inode just after 
	mount doesn't have to read the flash twice for large files.
	Make this a per-inode option, changable with chattr, so you can
	decide which inodes should be in-core immediately after mount.
 - stop it depending on a block device.
 - test, test, test

 - NAND flash support:
	- flush_wbuf using GC to fill it, don't just pad.
	- Deal with write errors. Data don't get lost - we just have to write 
	  the affected node(s) out again somewhere else.
	- make fsync flush only if actually required
	- make sys_sync() work.
	- reboot notifier
	- timed flush of old wbuf
	- fix magical second arg of jffs2_flush_wbuf(). Split into two or more functions instead.
