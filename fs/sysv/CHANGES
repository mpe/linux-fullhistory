Mon Dec 15 1997	  Krzysztof G. Baranowski <kgb@manjak.knm.org.pl>
	*    namei.c: struct sysv_dir_inode_operations updated to use dentries.

Fri Jan 23 1998   Krzysztof G. Baranowski <kgb@manjak.knm.org.pl>
	*    inode.c: corrected 1 track offset setting (in sb->sv_block_base).
		      Originally it was overridden (by setting to zero)
		      in detected_[xenix,sysv4,sysv2,coherent]. Thanks
		      to Andrzej Krzysztofowicz <ankry@mif.pg.gda.pl>
		      for identifying the problem.

Tue Jan 27 1998   Krzysztof G. Baranowski <kgb@manjak.knm.org.pl>
        *    inode.c: added 2048-byte block support to SystemV FS.
		      Merged detected_bs[512,1024,2048]() into one function:
		      void detected_bs (u_char type, struct super_block *sb).
		      Thanks to Andrzej Krzysztofowicz <ankry@mif.pg.gda.pl>
		      for the patch.

Wed Feb  4 1998   Krzysztof G. Baranowski <kgb@manjak.knm.org.pl>
	*    namei.c: removed static subdir(); is_subdir() from dcache.c
		      is used instead. Cosmetic changes.

Thu Dec  3 1998   Al Viro (viro@math.psu.edu)
	*    namei.c (sysv_rmdir):
		      Bugectomy: old check for victim being busy
		      (inode->i_count) wasn't replaced (with checking
		      dentry->d_count) and escaped Linus in the last round
		      of changes. Shot and buried.

Wed Dec  9 1998   AV
	*    namei.c (do_sysv_rename):
		       Fixed incorrect check for other owners + race.
		       Removed checks that went to VFS.
	*    namei.c (sysv_unlink):
		       Removed checks that went to VFS.

Thu Dec 10 1998   AV
	*    namei.c (do_mknod):
			Removed dead code - mknod is never asked to
			create a symlink or directory. Incidentially,
			it wouldn't do it right if it would be called.
