This is the implementation of the SystemV/Coherent filesystem for Linux.
It implements all of
  - Xenix FS,
  - SystemV/386 FS,
  - Coherent FS.

This is version alpha 5.

To install:
* You need Linux 0.99.14.
* Go to /usr/src/linux, unpack the tar file there, and patch the Linux source:
    patch -p1 < sysvfs.cdif
  To build the Linux kernel with the patches:
    make config
    make depend
    make
* To mount a disk or a partition, use
    mount [-r] -t sysv device mountpoint
  The file system type names
               -t sysv
               -t xenix
               -t coherent
  may be used interchangeably, but the last two will eventually disappear.

Bugs in the present implementation:
- Coherent FS:
  - The "free list interleave" n:m is currently ignored.
  - Only file systems with no filesystem name and no pack name are recognized.
  (See Coherent "man mkfs" for a description of these features.)
- SystemV Release 2 FS:
  The superblock is only searched in the blocks 9, 15, 18, which corresponds to the
  beginning of track 1 on floppy disks. No support for this FS on hard disk yet.
