A Partial List of Known Problems and Missing Features
=====================================================

Contributions are welcome.  There are plenty of opportunities
for visible, important contributions to this module.  Here
is a partial list of the known problems and missing features:

a) Support for SecurityDescriptors for chmod/chgrp/chown

b) Better pam/winbind integration

c) multi-user mounts - multiplexed sessionsetups over single vc
(ie tcp session) - prettying up needed

d) Kerberos/SPNEGO session setup support - (started)

e)NTLMv2 authentication and MD5-HMAC signing of SMB PDUs - (mostly implemented)

f) oplock support (ie safe CIFS distributed file caching) is not complete.
In addition Directory entry caching relies on a 1 second timer, rather than 
using FindNotify or equivalent.  - (started)

g) There may be a few additional changes that could be done to take advantage
of recent 2.5 kernel improvements in byte-range locking

h) quota support

i) support for the Linux 2.5 kernel new feature get_xattr and set_xattr

j) finish off the mount helper, mount.cifs - (started)

KNOWN BUGS (updated October 8nd, 2002)
====================================
1) symbolic links (Windows reparse points) are recognized but
can not be created remotely. They are implemented for Samba and those that
support the CIFS Unix extensions but Samba has a bug currently handling
symlink text beginning with slash
2) delete of file with read-only attribute set will fail (may be ok)
3) autoreconnection logic is only partially complete.
4) there may be a problem with truncating a memmapped file to smaller than 4k with
the size being reported as exactly 4k.

Misc testing to do
=================
1) check out max path names and max path name components against various server
types.

2) Run POSIX bencharks against cifs

3) Run dbench

4) Finish FSX testing on SMP now that we workaround the Samba bug
