access many recent Windows servers)

Version 0.83
------------
Fix oops when mounting to long server names caused by inverted parms to kmalloc.
Fix MultiuserMount (/proc/fs/cifs configuration setting) so that when enabled
we will choose a cifs user session (smb uid) that better matches the local

Fix shortened results on readdir of large directories to
servers supporting CIFS Unix extensions (caused by
incorrect resume key).

Version 0.74
------------
Fix truncate bug (set file size) that could cause hangs e.g. running fsx

Version 0.73
------------
unload nls if mount fails.

Version 0.72

reflected in the local inode immediately.  Cleanup of whitespace
to make 2.4 and 2.5 versions more consistent.


Version 0.67
------------
Fix signal sending so that captive thread (cifsd) exits on umount 
(which was causing the warning in kmem_cache_free of the request buffers
at rmmod time).  This had broken as a sideeffect of the recent global
kernel change to daemonize.  Fix memory leak in readdir code which
showed up in "ls -R" (and applications that did search rewinding).

Version 0.66
------------
Reconnect tids and fids after session reconnection (still do not
reconnect byte range locks though).  Fix problem caching
lookup information for directory inodes, improving performance,
especially in deep directory trees.  Fix various build warnings.

Version 0.65
------------
Finish fixes to commit write for caching/readahead consistency.  fsx 
now works to Samba servers.  Fix oops caused when readahead
was interrupted by a signal.

Version 0.64
------------
Fix data corruption (in partial page after truncate) that caused fsx to
fail to Windows servers.  Cleaned up some extraneous error logging in
common error paths.  Add generic sendfile support.

Version 0.63
------------
Fix memory leak in AllocMidQEntry.
Finish reconnection logic, so connection with server can be dropped
(or server rebooted) and the cifs client will reconnect.  

Version 0.62
------------
Fix temporary socket leak when bad userid or password specified 
(or other SMBSessSetup failure).  Increase maximum buffer size to slightly
over 16K to allow negotiation of up to Samba and Windows server default read 
sizes.  Add support for readpages

Version 0.61
------------
Fix oops when username not passed in on mount.  Extensive fixes and improvements
to error logging (strip redundant newlines, change debug macros to ensure newline
passed in and to be more consistent).  Fix writepage wrong file handle problem,
a readonly file handle could be incorrectly used to attempt to write out
file updates through the page cache to multiply open files.  This could cause
the iozone benchmark to fail on the fwrite test. Fix bug mounting two different
shares to the same Windows server when using different usernames
(doing this to Samba servers worked but Windows was rejecting it) - now it is
possible to use different userids when connecting to the same server from a
Linux client. Fix oops when treeDisconnect called during unmount on
previously freed socket.

Version 0.60
------------
Fix oops in readpages caused by not setting address space operations in inode in 
rare code path.

Version 0.54
------------
Fix problem with captive thread hanging around at unmount time.  Adjust to 2.5.42-pre
changes to superblock layout.   Remove wasteful allocation of smb buffers (now the send 
buffer is reused for responses).  Add more oplock handling. Additional minor cleanup.

Version 0.53
------------
More stylistic updates to better match kernel style.  Add additional statistics
for filesystem which can be viewed via /proc/fs/cifs.  Add more pieces of NTLMv2
and CIFS Packet Signing enablement.

Version 0.52

Version 0.42
------------
SessionSetup and NegotiateProtocol now work from Big Endian machines.
Various Big Endian fixes found during testing on the Linux on 390.  Various fixes for compatibility with older
versions of 2.4 kernel (now builds and works again on kernels at least as early as 2.4.7).

Version 0.41
------------
Various minor fixes for Connectathon Posix "basic" file i/o test suite.  Directory caching fixed so hardlinked
files now return the correct rumber of links on fstat as they are repeatedly linked and unlinked.

Version 0.40
------------
Implemented "Raw" (i.e. not encapsulated in SPNEGO) NTLMSSP (i.e. the Security Provider Interface used to negotiate
session advanced session authentication).  Raw NTLMSSP is preferred by Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP.
Began implementing support for SPNEGO encapsulation of NTLMSSP based session authentication blobs
(which is the mechanism preferred by Windows 2000 server in the absence of Kerberos).

Version 0.38
------------

it. Fixed a few bugs in the DFS code (e.g. bcc two bytes too short and incorrect uid in PDU).

Version 0.37
------------
Rewrote much of connection and mount/unmount logic to handle bugs with
multiple uses to same share, multiple users to same server etc.

Version 0.36
------------
Fixed major problem with dentry corruption (missing call to dput)

Version 0.35
------------
Rewrite of readdir code to fix bug. Various fixes for bigendian machines.

Support for STATUS codes (newer 32 bit NT error codes) added.  DFS support begun to be added.

Version 0.32
------------
Unix extensions (symlink, readlink, hardlink, chmod and some chgrp and chown) implemented
and tested against Samba 2.2.5


Version 0.31
------------
1) Fixed lockrange to be correct (it was one byte too short)

2) Fixed GETLK (i.e. the fcntl call to test a range of bytes in a file to see if locked) to correctly 
show range as locked when there is a conflict with an existing lock.

3) default file perms are now 2767 (indicating support for mandatory locks) instead of 777 for directories
in most cases.  Eventually will offer optional ability to query server for the correct perms.

3) Fixed eventual trap when mounting twice to different shares on the same server when the first succeeded 
but the second one was invalid and failed (the second one was incorrectly disconnecting the tcp and smb
session) 

4) Fixed error logging of valid mount options

5) Removed logging of password field.

6) Moved negotiate, treeDisconnect and uloggoffX (only tConx and SessSetup remain in connect.c) to cifssmb.c
and cleaned them up and made them more consistent with other cifs functions.

(with or without Unix exentions) but FindNext and QueryPathInfo with the Unix extensions are not completed,
nor is the symlink support using the Unix extensions

8) Started adding the readlink and follow_link code
