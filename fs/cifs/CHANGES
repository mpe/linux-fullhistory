Version 0.58
------------
Changed read and write to go through pagecache. Added additional address space operations.
Memory mapped operations now working.

Version 0.57
------------
Added writepage code for additional memory mapping support.  Fixed leak in xids causing
the simultaneous operations counter (/proc/fs/cifs/SimultaneousOps) to increase on 
every stat call.  Additional formatting cleanup. 

Version 0.56
------------
Fix bigendian bug in order of time conversion. Merge 2.5 to 2.4 version.  Formatting cleanup.   

Version 0.55
------------
Fixes from Zwane Mwaikambo for adding missing return code checking in a few places.
Also included a modified version of his fix to protect global list manipulation of
the smb session and tree connection and mid related global variables.

Version 0.54
------------
Fix problem with captive thread hanging around at unmount time.  Adjust to 2.5.42-pre
changes to superblock layout.   Remove wasteful allocation of smb buffers (now the send 
buffer is reused for responses).  Add more oplock handling. Additional minor cleanup.

Version 0.53
------------
More stylistic updates to better match kernel style.  Add additional statistics
for filesystem which can be viewed via /proc/fs/cifs.  Add more pieces of NTLMv2
and CIFS Packet Signing enablement.

Version 0.52
------------
Replace call to sleep_on with safer wait_on_event.
Make stylistic changes to better match kernel style recommendations.
Remove most typedef usage (except for the PDUs themselves).

Version 0.51
------------
Update mount so the -unc mount option is no longer required (the ip address can be specified
in a UNC style device name.   Implementation of readpage/writepage started.

Version 0.50
------------
Fix intermittent problem with incorrect smb header checking on badly 
fragmented tcp responses

Version 0.49
------------
Fixes to setting of allocation size and file size.

Version 0.48
------------
Various 2.5.38 fixes.  Now works on 2.5.38

Version 0.47
------------
Prepare for 2.5 kernel merge.  Remove ifdefs.

Version 0.46
------------
Socket buffer management fixes.  Fix dual free.

Version 0.45
------------
Various big endian fixes for hardlinks and symlinks and also for dfs.

Version 0.44
------------
Various big endian fixes for servers with Unix extensions such as Samba

Version 0.43
------------
Various FindNext fixes for incorrect filenames on large directory searches on big endian
clients.  basic posix file i/o tests now work on big endian machines, not just le

Version 0.42
------------
SessionSetup and NegotiateProtocol now work from Big Endian machines.
Various Big Endian fixes found during testing on the Linux on 390.  Various fixes for compatability with older
versions of 2.4 kernel (now builds and works again on kernels at least as early as 2.4.7).

Version 0.41
------------
Various minor fixes for Connectathon Posix "basic" file i/o test suite.  Directory caching fixed so hardlinked
files now return the correct rumber of links on fstat as they are repeatedly linked and unlinked.

Version 0.40
------------
Implemented "Raw" (i.e. not encapsulated in SPNEGO) NTLMSSP (i.e. the Security Provider Interface used to negotiate
session advanced session authentication).  Raw NTLMSSP is preferred by Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP.
Began implementing support for SPNEGO encapsulation of NTLMSSP based session authentication blobs
(which is the mechanism preferred by Windows 2000 server in the absence of Kerberos).

Version 0.38
------------
Introduced optional mount helper utility mount.cifs and made coreq changes to cifs vfs to enable
it. Fixed a few bugs in the DFS code (e.g. bcc two bytes too short and incorrect uid in PDU).

Version 0.37
------------
Rewrote much of connection and mount/unmount logic to handle bugs with
multiple uses to same share, multiple users to same server etc.

Version 0.36
------------
Fixed major problem with dentry corruption (missing call to dput)

Version 0.35
------------
Rewrite of readdir code to fix bug. Various fixes for bigendian machines.
Begin adding oplock support.  Multiusermount and oplockEnabled flags added to /proc/fs/cifs
although corresponding function not fully implemented in the vfs yet

Version 0.34
------------
Fixed dentry caching bug, misc. cleanup 

Version 0.33
------------
Fixed 2.5 support to handle build and configure changes as well as misc. 2.5 changes.  Now can build
on current 2.5 beta version (2.5.24) of the Linux kernel as well as on 2.4 Linux kernels.
Support for STATUS codes (newer 32 bit NT error codes) added.  DFS support begun to be added.

Version 0.32
------------
Unix extensions (symlink, readlink, hardlink, chmod and some chgrp and chown) implemented
and tested against Samba 2.2.5


Version 0.31
------------
1) Fixed lockrange to be correct (it was one byte too short)

2) Fixed GETLK (i.e. the fcntl call to test a range of bytes in a file to see if locked) to correctly 
show range as locked when there is a conflict with an existing lock.

3) default file perms are now 2767 (indicating support for mandatory locks) instead of 777 for directories
in most cases.  Eventually will offer optional ability to query server for the correct perms.

3) Fixed eventual trap when mounting twice to different shares on the same server when the first succeeded 
but the second one was invalid and failed (the second one was incorrectly disconnecting the tcp and smb
session) 

4) Fixed error logging of valid mount options

5) Removed logging of password field.

6) Moved negotiate, treeDisconnect and uloggoffX (only tConx and SessSetup remain in connect.c) to cifssmb.c
and cleaned them up and made them more consistent with other cifs functions. 

7) Server support for Unix extensions is now fully detected and FindFirst is implemented both ways 
(with or without Unix exentions) but FindNext and QueryPathInfo with the Unix extensions are not completed,
nor is the symlink support using the Unix extensions

8) Started adding the readlink and follow_link code 

Version 0.3 
-----------
Initial drop
