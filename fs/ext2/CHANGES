Changes from version 0.4 to version 0.4a
========================================
        - the `sync' option support is now complete.  Version 0.4 was not
          supporting it when truncating a file.  I have tested the synchronous
          writes and they work but they make the system very slow :-(  I have
          to work again on this to make it faster.
        - when detecting an error on a mounted filesystem, version 0.4 used
          to try to write a flag in the super block even if the filesystem had
          been mounted read-only.  This is fixed.
        - the `sb=#' option now causes the kernel code to use the filesystem
          descriptors located at block #+1.  Version 0.4 used the superblock
          backup located at block # but used the main copy of the descriptors.
        - a new file attribute `S' is supported.  This attribute causes
          synchronous writes but is applied to a file not to the entire file
          system (thanks to Michael Kraehe <kraehe@bakunin.north.de> for
          suggesting it).
        - the directory cache is inhibited by default.  The cache management
          code seems to be buggy and I have to look at it carefully before
          using it again.
        - deleting a file with the `s' attribute (secure deletion) causes its
          blocks to be overwritten with random values not with zeros (thanks to
          Michael A. Griffith <grif@cs.ucr.edu> for suggesting it).
        - lots of cosmetic changes have been made.

Changes from version 0.3 to version 0.4
=======================================
        - Three new mount options are supported: `check', `sync' and `sb=#'.
          `check' tells the kernel code to make more consistency checks
          when the file system is mounted.  Currently, the kernel code checks
          that the blocks and inodes bitmaps are consistent with the free
          blocks and inodes counts.  More checks will be added in future
          releases.
          `sync' tells the kernel code to use synchronous writes when updating
          an inode, a bitmap, a directory entry or an indirect block.  This
          can make the file system much slower but can be a big win for files
          recovery in case of a crash (and we can now say to the BSD folks
          that Linux also supports synchronous updates :-).
          `sb=#' tells the kernel code to use an alternate super block instead
          of its master copy.  `#' is the number of the block (counted in
          1024 bytes blocks) which contains the alternate super block.
          An ext2 file system typically contains backups of the super block
          at blocks 8193, 16385, and so on.
        - I have change the meaning of the valid flag used by e2fsck.  it
          now contains the state of the file system.  If the kernel code
          detects an inconsistency while the file system is mounted, it flags
          it as erroneous and e2fsck will detect that on next run.
        - The super block now contains a mount counter.  This counter is
          incremented each time the file system is mounted read/write.   When
          this counter becomes bigger than a maximal mount counts (also stored
          in the super block), e2fsck checks the file system, even if it had
          been unmounted cleany, and resets this counter to 0.
        - File attributes are now supported.  One can associate a set of
          attributes to a file.  Three attributes are defined:
          `c': the file is marked for automatic compression,
          `s': the file is marked for secure deletion: when the file is
          deleted, its blocks are zeroed and written back to the disk,
          `u': the file is marked for undeletion: when the file is deleted,
          its contents are saved to allow a future undeletion.
          Currently, only the `s' attribute is implemented in the kernel
          code.  Support for the other attributes will be added in a future
          release.
        - a few bugs related to times updates have been fixed by Bruce
          Evans and me.
        - a bug related to the links count of deleted inodes has been fixed.
          Previous versions used to keep the links count set to 1 when a file
          was deleted.  The new version now sets links_count to 0 when deleting
          the last link.
        - a race condition when deallocating an inode has been fixed by
          Stephen Tweedie.
