 * This is only called from sys_fsync(), sys_fdatasync() and sys_msync().
 * There cannot be a transaction open by this task. (AKPM: quotas?)
 * Another task could have dirtied this inode.  Its data can be in any
 * state in the journalling system.
 *
 * What we do is just kick off a commit and wait on it.  This will snapshot the
 * inode to disk.
 *
 * Note that there is a serious optimisation we can make here: if the current
 * inode is not part of j_running_transaction or j_committing_transaction
 * then we have nothing to do.  That would require implementation of t_ilist,
 * which isn't too hard.
