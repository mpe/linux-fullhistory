 * Limit file size to the page cache limit on architectures where unsigned long
 * is 32-bits. This is the most we can do for now without overflowing the page
 * cache page index. Doing it this way means we don't run into problems because
 * of existing too large files. It would be better to allow the user to read
 * the beginning of the file but I doubt very much anyone is going to hit this
 * check on a 32-bit architecture, so there is no point in adding the extra
 * complexity required to support this.
 *
 * On 64-bit architectures, the check is hopefully optimized away by the
 * compiler.
 *
 * After the check passes, just call generic_file_open() to do its work.

 * @filp:	file to be synced

 * @datasync:	if non-zero only flush user data and not metadata
 *
 * Data integrity sync of a file to disk.  Used for fsync, fdatasync, and msync
 * system calls.  This function is inspired by fs/buffer.c::file_fsync().
 *
 * If @datasync is false, write the mft record and all associated extent mft
 * records as well as the $DATA attribute and then sync the block device.
 *
 * If @datasync is true and the attribute is non-resident, we skip the writing
 * of the mft record and all associated extent mft records (this might still
 * happen due to the write_inode_now() call).
 *
 * Also, if @datasync is true, we do not wait on the inode to be written out
 * but we always wait on the page cache pages to be written out.
 *
 * Note: In the past @filp could be NULL so we ignore it as we don't need it
 * anyway.
 *
 * Locking: Caller must hold i_sem on the inode.
 *
 * TODO: We should probably also write all attribute/index inodes associated
 * with this inode but since we have no simple way of getting to them we ignore
 * this problem for now.
