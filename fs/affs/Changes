(Note: I consider version numbers as cheap. That means
that I do not like numbers like 0.1 and the like for
things that can be used since quite some time. But
then, 3.1 doesn't mean 'perfectly stable', too.)

Known bugs:
-----------

- Doesn't work on the alpha. The only 64/32-bit
  problem that I'm aware of (pointer/int conversion
  in readdir()) gives compiler warnings but is
  apparently not causing the failure, as directory
  reads basically work (but all files are of size 0).
  Alas, I've got no alpha to debug. :-(
- If an affs mounted filesystem is exported via
  nfs, it cannot be written to. No networking to
  test that, either. :-(

Please direct bug reports to: hjw@zvw.de

Version 3.4
-----------

- Hash chains are now sorted by block numbers.
  (Thanks to Kars de Jong for finding this.)
- Removed all unnecessary external symbols.

Version 3.3
-----------

- Tried to make all types 'correct' and consistent.
- Errors and warnings are now reported via a
  function. They are all prefixed by a severity
  and have the same appearance:
    "AFFS: <function>: <error message>"
  (There's one exception to this, as in that function
  is no pointer to the super block available.)
- The filesystem is remounted read-only after an
  error.
- The names of newly created filesystem objects are
  now checked for validity.
- Minor cleanups in comments.
- Added this Changes file. At last!

Version 3.2
-----------

- Extension block cache: Reading/writing of huge files
  (several MB) is much faster (of course the added
  overhead slows down opening, but this is hardly
  noticeable).
- The same get_block()-routine can now be used for
  both OFS and FFS.
- The super block is now searched in the block that
  was calculated and in the one following. This
  should remedy the round-off error introduced by
  the 1-k blocks that Linux uses.
- Minor changes to adhere to the new VFS interface.
- The number of used blocks is now also calculated
  if the filesystem is mounted read-only.
- Prefixed some constants with AFFS_ to avoid name
  clashes.
- Removed 'EXPERIMENTAL' status.

Version 3.1
-----------

- Fixed a nasty bug which didn't allow read-only
  mounts.
- Allow dir-cache filesystems to be mounted
  read only.
- OFS support.
- Several other changes I just cannot remember
  any more.

Version 3.0
-----------

- Almost complete rewrite for the new VFS
  interface in Linux 1.3.
- Write support.
- Support for hard and symbolic links.
- Lots of things I remeber even less ...

Version 2.0
-----------

- Fixed a few things to get it compiled.
- Automatic root block calculation.
- Partition checker for genhd.c

========================================

Let's just call Ray Burr's original affs
'Version 1.0'.
