- Files in a subdir can't be accessed, I think that the inode information
  is not correctly copied at some point. Solved 06-06-1998, Richard.
  
- At some point the mounted device can't be unmounted. I think that somewhere
  in the code a buffer is not given free.

- Make the '..' entry work, I give it a great chance that the above bug
  (not given free) has something to do with this one, after a 'ls -l'
  the mounted device can't be unmounted and that's where the '..' entry
  is accessed.
  Seems to be solved 21-06-1998, Frank.
