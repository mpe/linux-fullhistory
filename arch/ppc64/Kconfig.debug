config DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW
	bool "Check for stack overflows"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL

config DEBUG_STACK_USAGE
	bool "Stack utilization instrumentation"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Enables the display of the minimum amount of free stack which each
	  task has ever had available in the sysrq-T and sysrq-P debug output.

	  This option will slow down process creation somewhat.

config DEBUGGER
	bool "Enable debugger hooks"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Include in-kernel hooks for kernel debuggers. Unless you are
	  intending to debug the kernel, say N here.

config XMON
	bool "Include xmon kernel debugger"
	depends on DEBUGGER
	help
	  Include in-kernel hooks for the xmon kernel monitor/debugger.
	  Unless you are intending to debug the kernel, say N here.

config XMON_DEFAULT
	bool "Enable xmon by default"
	depends on XMON

config PPCDBG
	bool "Include PPCDBG realtime debugging"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL

config IRQSTACKS
	bool "Use separate kernel stacks when processing interrupts"
	help
	  If you say Y here the kernel will use separate kernel stacks
	  for handling hard and soft interrupts.  This can help avoid
	  overflowing the process kernel stacks.

config SCHEDSTATS
	bool "Collect scheduler statistics"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && PROC_FS
	help
	  If you say Y here, additional code will be inserted into the
	  scheduler and related routines to collect statistics about
	  scheduler behavior and provide them in /proc/schedstat.  These
	  stats may be useful for both tuning and debugging the scheduler
	  If you aren't debugging the scheduler or trying to tune a specific
	  application, you can say N to avoid the very slight overhead
	  this adds.
