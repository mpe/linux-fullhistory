config DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW
	bool "Check for stack overflows"

config DEBUG_STACK_USAGE
	bool "Stack utilization instrumentation"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Enables the display of the minimum amount of free stack which each
	  task has ever had available in the sysrq-T and sysrq-P debug output.

	  This option will slow down process creation somewhat.

config DEBUGGER
	bool "Enable debugger hooks"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Include in-kernel hooks for kernel debuggers. Unless you are
	  intending to debug the kernel, say N here.

config XMON
	bool "Include xmon kernel debugger"
	depends on DEBUGGER
	help
	  Include in-kernel hooks for the xmon kernel monitor/debugger.
	  Unless you are intending to debug the kernel, say N here.

config XMON_DEFAULT
	bool "Enable xmon by default"
	depends on XMON

config PPCDBG
	bool "Include PPCDBG realtime debugging"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL

config IRQSTACKS
	bool "Use separate kernel stacks when processing interrupts"
	help
	  If you say Y here the kernel will use separate kernel stacks
	  for handling hard and soft interrupts.  This can help avoid
	  overflowing the process kernel stacks.
