config POWER4_ONLY
	bool "Optimize for POWER4"
	default n
	---help---
	  Cause the compiler to optimize for POWER4 processors. The resulting
	  binary will not work on POWER3 or RS64 processors when compiled with
	  binutils 2.15 or later.

config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, say N. If you have a system with more
	  than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on single-processor machines.
	  On a single-processor machine, the kernel will run faster if you say
	  N here.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say Y.

config IRQ_ALL_CPUS
	bool "Distribute interrupts on all CPUs by default"
	depends on SMP && PPC_PSERIES
	help
	  This option gives the kernel permission to distribute IRQs across
	  multiple CPUs.  Saying N here will route all IRQs to the first
	  CPU.

config NR_CPUS
	int "Maximum number of CPUs (2-128)"
	range 2 128

config NUMA

config PREEMPT
	bool
	help
	  This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
	  real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
	  be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
	  Unfortunately the kernel code has some race conditions if both
	  CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_PREEMPT are enabled, so this option is
	  currently disabled if you are building an SMP kernel.

	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for a desktop, embedded
	  or real-time system.  Say N if you are unsure.

config ISA
	bool
	help
	  Find out whether you have ISA slots on your motherboard.  ISA is the
	  name of a bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff
	  inside your box.  If you have an Apple machine, say N here; if you
	  have an IBM RS/6000 or pSeries machine or a PReP machine, say Y.  If
	  you have an embedded board, consult your board documentation.

config SBUS
	bool

config MCA
	bool

config EISA
	bool

config PCI
	bool
	default y
	help
	  Find out whether your system includes a PCI bus. PCI is the name of
	  a bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
	  your box.  If you say Y here, the kernel will include drivers and
	  infrastructure code to support PCI bus devices.

config HOTPLUG
	bool "Support for hot-pluggable devices"
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to plug devices into your computer while
	  the system is running, and be able to use them quickly.  In many
	  cases, the devices can likewise be unplugged at any time too.

	  One well known example of this is PCMCIA- or PC-cards, credit-card
	  size devices such as network cards, modems or hard drives which are
	  plugged into slots found on all modern laptop computers.  Another
	  example, used on modern desktops as well as laptops, is USB.

	  Enable HOTPLUG and KMOD, and build a modular kernel.  Get agent
	  software (at <http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/>) and install it.
	  Then your kernel will automatically call out to a user mode "policy
	  agent" (/sbin/hotplug) to load modules and set up software needed
	  to use devices as you hotplug them.

config PROC_DEVICETREE
	bool "Support for Open Firmware device tree in /proc"
	depends on !PPC_ISERIES
	help
	  This option adds a device-tree directory under /proc which contains
	  an image of the device tree that the kernel copies from Open
	  Firmware. If unsure, say Y here.

config CMDLINE_BOOL
	bool "Default bootloader kernel arguments"
	depends on !PPC_ISERIES

config CMDLINE
	string "Initial kernel command string"
	depends on CMDLINE_BOOL
	default "console=ttyS0,9600 console=tty0 root=/dev/sda2"
	help
	  On some platforms, there is currently no way for the boot loader to
	  pass arguments to the kernel. For these platforms, you can supply
	  some command-line options at build time by entering them here.  In
	  most cases you will need to specify the root device here.

 	  virtual disks created and managed by OS/400, say Y.

config VIODASD_IDE
	bool "iSeries Virtual disk IDE emulation"
	depends on VIODASD
	help
	  This causes the iSeries virtual disks to look like IDE disks.
	  If you have programs or utilities that only support certain
	  kinds of disks, this option will cause iSeries virtual disks
	  to pretend to be IDE disks, which may satisfy the program.

	  identify kernel problems.

config DEBUG_SLAB
	bool "Debug memory allocations"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here to have the kernel do limited verification on memory
	  allocation as well as poisoning memory on free to catch use of freed
	  memory.

config MAGIC_SYSRQ
	bool "Magic SysRq key"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will have some control over the system even
	  if the system crashes for example during kernel debugging (e.g., you
	  will be able to flush the buffer cache to disk, reboot the system
	  immediately or dump some status information). This is accomplished
	  by pressing various keys while holding SysRq (Alt+PrintScreen). It
	  also works on a serial console (on PC hardware at least), if you
	  send a BREAK and then within 5 seconds a command keypress. The
	  keys are documented in <file:Documentation/sysrq.txt>. Don't say Y
	  unless you really know what this hack does.

config XMON
	bool "Include xmon kernel debugger"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Include in-kernel hooks for the xmon kernel monitor/debugger.
	  Unless you are intending to debug the kernel, say N here.

	help
          If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will include
	  debugging info resulting in a larger kernel image.
	  Say Y here only if you plan to use gdb to debug the kernel.
	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N.
