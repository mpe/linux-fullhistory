	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, say N. If you have a system with more
	  than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on single-processor machines.
	  On a single-processor machine, the kernel will run faster if you say
	  N here.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say Y.

	  This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to

	  Unfortunately the kernel code has some race conditions if both
	  CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_PREEMPT are enabled, so this option is
	  currently disabled if you are building an SMP kernel.

	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for a desktop, embedded

	  Find out whether you have ISA slots on your motherboard.  ISA is the

	  inside your box.  If you have an Apple machine, say N here; if you

	help
	  If you enabled support for /proc file system then the file
	  /proc/kcore will contain the kernel core image in ELF format. This
	  can be used in gdb:

	  $ cd /usr/src/linux ; gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore

	  This is especially useful if you have compiled the kernel with the
	  "-g" option to preserve debugging information. It is mainly used
	  for examining kernel data structures on the live kernel.

config BINFMT_ELF
	bool "Kernel support for 64-bit ELF binaries"
	help
	  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and
	  executables used across different architectures and operating
	  systems.

config BINFMT_MISC
	tristate "Kernel support for MISC binaries"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to plug wrapper-driven binary
	  formats into the kernel. You will like this especially when you use
	  programs that need an interpreter to run like Java, Python or
	  Emacs-Lisp.  It's also useful if you often run DOS executables under
	  the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>).  Once you have
	  registered such a binary class with the kernel, you can start one of
	  those programs simply by typing in its name at a shell prompt; Linux
	  will automatically feed it to the correct interpreter.

	  You can do other nice things, too. Read the file
	  <file:Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt> to learn how to use this
	  feature, and <file:Documentation/java.txt> for information about how
	  to include Java support.

	  You must say Y to "/proc file system support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) to
	  use this part of the kernel.

	  You may say M here for module support and later load the module when
	  you have use for it; the module is called binfmt_misc. If you
	  don't know what to answer at this point, say Y.

config HOTPLUG
	bool "Support for hot-pluggable devices"
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to plug devices into your computer while
	  the system is running, and be able to use them quickly.  In many
	  cases, the devices can likewise be unplugged at any time too.

	  One well known example of this is PCMCIA- or PC-cards, credit-card
	  size devices such as network cards, modems or hard drives which are
	  plugged into slots found on all modern laptop computers.  Another
	  example, used on modern desktops as well as laptops, is USB.

	  Enable HOTPLUG and KMOD, and build a modular kernel.  Get agent
	  software (at <http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/>) and install it.
	  Then your kernel will automatically call out to a user mode "policy
	  agent" (/sbin/hotplug) to load modules and set up software needed
	  to use devices as you hotplug them.

	  On some platforms, there is currently no way for the boot loader to
	  pass arguments to the kernel. For these platforms, you can supply
	  some command-line options at build time by entering them here.  In
	  most cases you will need to specify the root device here.

config IDE
	tristate "ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL support"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, your kernel will be able to manage low cost mass
	  storage units such as ATA/(E)IDE and ATAPI units. The most common
	  cases are IDE hard drives and ATAPI CD-ROM drives.

	  If your system is pure SCSI and doesn't use these interfaces, you
	  can say N here.

	  Integrated Disk Electronics (IDE aka ATA-1) is a connecting standard
	  for mass storage units such as hard disks. It was designed by
	  Western Digital and Compaq Computer in 1984.  Quite a number of
	  disks use the IDE interface.

	  Fast-IDE is ATA-2 (also named Fast ATA), Enhanced IDE (EIDE) is
	  ATA-3. It provides support for larger disks (up to 8.4GB by means of
	  the LBA standard), more disks (4 instead of 2) and for other mass
	  storage units such as tapes and cdrom. UDMA/33 (aka UltraDMA/33) is
	  ATA-4 and provides faster (and more CPU friendly) transfer modes
	  than previous PIO (Programmed processor Input/Output) from previous
	  ATA/IDE standards by means of fast DMA controllers.

	  ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) is a protocol used by EIDE tape and
	  CD-ROM drives, similar in many respects to the SCSI protocol.

	  SMART IDE (Self Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) was
	  designed in order to prevent data corruption and disk crash by
	  detecting pre hardware failure conditions (heat, access time, and
	  the like...). Disks built since June 1995 may follow this standard.
	  The kernel itself don't manage this; however there are quite a
	  number of user programs such as smart that can query the status of
	  SMART parameters disk.

	  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module
	  will be called ide.

	  For further information, please read <file:Documentation/ide.txt>.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config SCSI
	tristate "SCSI device support"
	---help---
	  If you want to use a SCSI hard disk, SCSI tape drive, SCSI CD-ROM or
	  any other SCSI device under Linux, say Y and make sure that you know
	  the name of your SCSI host adapter (the card inside your computer
	  that "speaks" the SCSI protocol, also called SCSI controller),
	  because you will be asked for it.

	  You also need to say Y here if you want support for the parallel
	  port version of the 100 MB IOMEGA ZIP drive.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called scsi_mod.  If you want to compile it as
	  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> and
	  <file:Documentation/scsi/scsi.txt>.  However, do not compile this as a
	  module if your root file system (the one containing the directory /)
	  is located on a SCSI device.

config SOUND
	tristate "Sound card support"
	---help---
	  If you have a sound card in your computer, i.e. if it can say more
	  than an occasional beep, say Y.  Be sure to have all the information
	  about your sound card and its configuration down (I/O port,
	  interrupt and DMA channel), because you will be asked for it.

	  You want to read the Sound-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. General information about
	  the modular sound system is contained in the files
	  <file:Documentation/sound/Introduction>.  The file
	  <file:Documentation/sound/README.OSS> contains some slightly
	  outdated but still useful information as well.

	  If you have a PnP sound card and you want to configure it at boot
	  time using the ISA PnP tools (read
	  <http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/>), then you need to
	  compile the sound card support as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want)
	  and load that module after the PnP configuration is finished.  To do
	  this, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well
	  as <file:Documentation/sound/README.modules>; the module will be
	  called soundcore.

	  I'm told that even without a sound card, you can make your computer
	  say more than an occasional beep, by programming the PC speaker.
	  Kernel patches and supporting utilities to do that are in the pcsp
	  package, available at <ftp://ftp.infradead.org/pub/pcsp/>.
