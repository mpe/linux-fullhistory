config MODE_TT
	bool "Tracing thread support"
	default y
	help
	This option controls whether tracing thread support is compiled
	into UML.  Normally, this should be set to Y.  If you intend to
	use only skas mode (and the host has the skas patch applied to it),
	then it is OK to say N here.

config STATIC_LINK
	bool "Force a static link"
	default n
	depends on !MODE_TT
	help
	If CONFIG_MODE_TT is disabled, then this option gives you the ability
	to force a static link of UML.  Normally, if only skas mode is built
	in to UML, it will be linked as a shared binary.  This is inconvenient
	for use in a chroot jail.  So, if you intend to run UML inside a
	chroot, and you disable CONFIG_MODE_TT, you probably want to say Y
	here.

config MODE_SKAS
	bool "Separate Kernel Address Space support"
	default y
	help
	This option controls whether skas (separate kernel address space)
	support is compiled in.  If you have applied the skas patch to the
	host, then you certainly want to say Y here (and consider saying N
	to CONFIG_MODE_TT).  Otherwise, it is safe to say Y.  Disabling this
	option will shrink the UML binary slightly.

config NET
	bool "Networking support"
	help
	Unless you really know what you are doing, you should say Y here.
	The reason is that some programs need kernel networking support even
	when running on a stand-alone machine that isn't connected to any
	other computer. If you are upgrading from an older kernel, you
	should consider updating your networking tools too because changes
	in the kernel and the tools often go hand in hand. The tools are
	contained in the package net-tools, the location and version number
	of which are given in Documentation/Changes.

	For a general introduction to Linux networking, it is highly
	recommended to read the NET-HOWTO, available from
	<http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

config HOSTFS
	tristate "Host filesystem"
	help
        While the User-Mode Linux port uses its own root file system for
        booting and normal file access, this module lets the UML user
        access files stored on the host.  It does not require any
        network connection between the Host and UML.  An example use of
        this might be:

        mount none /tmp/fromhost -t hostfs -o /tmp/umlshare

        where /tmp/fromhost is an empty directory inside UML and
        /tmp/umlshare is a directory on the host with files the UML user
        wishes to access.

        For more information, see
        <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/hostfs.html>.

        If you'd like to be able to work with files stored on the host,
        say Y or M here; otherwise say N.

config HPPFS
	tristate "HoneyPot ProcFS"
	help
	hppfs (HoneyPot ProcFS) is a filesystem which allows UML /proc
	entries to be overridden, removed, or fabricated from the host.
	Its purpose is to allow a UML to appear to be a physical machine
	by removing or changing anything in /proc which gives away the
	identity of a UML.

	See http://user-mode-linux.sf.net/hppfs.html for more information.

	You only need this if you are setting up a UML honeypot.  Otherwise,
	it is safe to say 'N' here.

config MCONSOLE
	bool "Management console"
	help
        The user mode linux management console is a low-level interface to
        the kernel, somewhat like the i386 SysRq interface.  Since there is
        a full-blown operating system running under every user mode linux
        instance, there is much greater flexibility possible than with the
        SysRq mechanism.

        If you answer 'Y' to this option, to use this feature, you need the
        mconsole client (called uml_mconsole) which is present in CVS in
        2.4.5-9um and later (path /tools/mconsole), and is also in the
        distribution RPM package in 2.4.6 and later.

        It is safe to say 'Y' here.

config HOST_2G_2G
	bool "2G/2G host address space split"

config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	default n
	help
        This option enables UML SMP support.  UML implements virtual SMP by
        allowing as many processes to run simultaneously on the host as
        there are virtual processors configured.  Obviously, if the host is
        a uniprocessor, those processes will timeshare, but, inside UML,
        will appear to be running simultaneously.  If the host is a
        multiprocessor, then UML processes may run simultaneously, depending
        on the host scheduler.
        It is safe to leave this unchanged.

config NR_CPUS
	int "Maximum number of CPUs (2-32)"
	range 2 32
	depends on SMP
	default "32"

config NEST_LEVEL
	int "Nesting level"
	default "0"
	help
        This is set to the number of layers of UMLs that this UML will be run
        in.  Normally, this is zero, meaning that it will run directly on the
        host.  Setting it to one will build a UML that can run inside a UML
        that is running on the host.  Generally, if you intend this UML to run
        inside another UML, set CONFIG_NEST_LEVEL to one more than the host
        UML.

        Note that if the hosting UML has its CONFIG_KERNEL_HALF_GIGS set to
        greater than one, then the guest UML should have its CONFIG_NEST_LEVEL
        set to the host's CONFIG_NEST_LEVEL + CONFIG_KERNEL_HALF_GIGS.
        Only change this if you are running nested UMLs.

config KERNEL_HALF_GIGS
	int "Kernel address space size (in .5G units)"
	default "1"
	help
        This determines the amount of address space that UML will allocate for
        its own, measured in half Gigabyte units.  The default is 1.
        Change this only if you need to boot UML with an unusually large amount
        of physical memory.

config HIGHMEM
	bool "Highmem support"
	depends on BROKEN

config KERNEL_STACK_ORDER
	int "Kernel stack size order"
	default 2
	help
	This option determines the size of UML kernel stacks.  They will
	be 1 << order pages.  The default is OK unless you're running Valgrind
	on UML, in which case, set this to 3.

config UML_REAL_TIME_CLOCK
	bool "Real-time Clock"
	default y
	help
	This option makes UML time deltas match wall clock deltas.  This should
	normally be enabled.  The exception would be if you are debugging with
	UML and spend long times with UML stopped at a breakpoint.  In this
	case, when UML is restarted, it will call the timer enough times to make
	up for the time spent at the breakpoint.  This could result in a
	noticable lag.  If this is a problem, then disable this option.
