config EARLY_PRINTK
	bool "Early printk" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	help
	  Write kernel log output directly into the VGA buffer or to a serial
	  port.

	  This is useful for kernel debugging when your machine crashes very
	  early before the console code is initialized. For normal operation
	  it is not recommended because it looks ugly and doesn't cooperate
	  with klogd/syslogd or the X server. You should normally N here,
	  unless you want to debug such a crash.

config DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW
	bool "Check for stack overflows"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL

config KPROBES
	bool "Kprobes"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Kprobes allows you to trap at almost any kernel address and
	  execute a callback function.  register_kprobe() establishes
	  a probepoint and specifies the callback.  Kprobes is useful
	  for kernel debugging, non-intrusive instrumentation and testing.
	  If in doubt, say "N".

config DEBUG_STACK_USAGE
	bool "Stack utilization instrumentation"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Enables the display of the minimum amount of free stack which each
	  task has ever had available in the sysrq-T and sysrq-P debug output.

	  This option will slow down process creation somewhat.

config DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
	bool "Page alloc debugging"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Unmap pages from the kernel linear mapping after free_pages().
	  This results in a large slowdown, but helps to find certain types
	  of memory corruptions.

config 4KSTACKS
	bool "Use 4Kb for kernel stacks instead of 8Kb"
	help
	  If you say Y here the kernel will use a 4Kb stacksize for the
	  kernel stack attached to each process/thread. This facilitates
	  running more threads on a system and also reduces the pressure
	  on the VM subsystem for higher order allocations. This option
	  will also use IRQ stacks to compensate for the reduced stackspace.

config X86_FIND_SMP_CONFIG
	bool
	depends on X86_LOCAL_APIC || X86_VOYAGER
	default y

config X86_MPPARSE
	bool
	depends on X86_LOCAL_APIC && !X86_VISWS
	default y
