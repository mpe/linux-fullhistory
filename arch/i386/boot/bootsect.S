 * BIG FAT NOTE: We're in real mode using 64k segments.  Therefore segment
 * addresses must be multiplied by 16 to obtain their respective linear
 * addresses. To avoid confusion, linear addresses are written using leading
 * hex while segment addresses are written as segment:offset.
 *
 * bde - should not jump blindly, there may be systems with only 512K low
 * memory.  Use int 0x12 to get the top of memory, etc.
 *
 * It then loads 'setup' directly after itself (0x90200), and the system
 * at 0x10000, using BIOS interrupts. 
 *
 * NOTE! currently system is at most (8*65536-4096) bytes long. This should 
 * be no problem, even in the future. I want to keep it simple. This 508 kB
 * kernel size should be enough, especially as this doesn't contain the
 * buffer cache as in minix (and especially now that the kernel is 
 * compressed :-)
 *
 * The loader has been made as simple as possible, and continuous
 * read errors will result in a unbreakable loop. Reboot by hand. It
 * loads pretty fast by getting whole tracks at a time whenever possible.
