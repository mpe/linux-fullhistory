config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  Clock scaling allows you to change the clock speed of CPUs on the
	  fly. This is a nice method to save battery power on notebooks,
	  because the lower the clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  For more information, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpufreq or
	  at <http://www.brodo.de/cpufreq/>

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_24_API
	bool "/proc/sys/cpu/ interface (2.4. / OLD)"
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	help
	  This enables the /proc/sys/cpu/ sysctl interface for controlling
	  CPUFreq, as known from the 2.4.-kernel patches for CPUFreq. 2.5
	  uses a sysfs interface instead. Please note that some drivers do 
	  not work well with the 2.4. /proc/sys/cpu sysctl interface,
	  so if in doubt, say N here.

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpufreq. 

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_TABLE
       tristate "CPU frequency table helpers"
       depends on CPU_FREQ
       default y
       help
         Many CPUFreq drivers use these helpers, so only say N here if
	 the CPUFreq driver of your choice doesn't need these helpers.

	 If in doubt, say Y.

config X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ
	tristate "ACPI Processor P-States driver"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_TABLE && ACPI_PROCESSOR
	help
	  This driver adds a CPUFreq driver which utilizes the ACPI
	  Processor Performance States.

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpufreq. 

	  If in doubt, say N.

config ELAN_CPUFREQ
	tristate "AMD Elan"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_TABLE && MELAN
	---help---
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for AMD Elan SC400 and SC410
	  processors.

	  You need to specify the processor maximum speed as boot
	  parameter: elanfreq=maxspeed (in kHz) or as module
	  parameter "max_freq".

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpufreq. 

	  If in doubt, say N.

	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for mobile AMD K6-2+ and mobile
	  AMD K6-3+ processors.

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpufreq. 

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_POWERNOW_K7
	tristate "AMD Mobile Athlon/Duron PowerNow!"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for mobile AMD K7 mobile processors.

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpufreq. 

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_GX_SUSPMOD
	tristate "Cyrix MediaGX/NatSemi Geode Suspend Modulation"
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	help
	 This add the CPUFreq driver for NatSemi Geode processors which
	 support suspend modulation.

	 For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpufreq.

	 If in doubt, say N.

config X86_SPEEDSTEP
	tristate "Intel Speedstep"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for certain mobile Intel Pentium III
	  (Coppermine), all mobile Intel Pentium III-M (Tulatin) and all
	  mobile Intel Pentium 4 P4-Ms.

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpufreq.
