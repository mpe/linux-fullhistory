/* This function must be called with interrupts disabled

 * However, the pc-audio speaker driver changes the divisor so that
 * it gets interrupted rather more often - it loads 64 into the
 * counter rather than 11932! This has an adverse impact on
 * do_gettimeoffset() -- it stops working! What is also not
 * good is that the interval that our timer function gets called
 * is no longer 10.0002 ms, but 9.9767 ms. To get around this
 * would require using a different timing source. Maybe someone
 * could use the RTC - I know that this can interrupt at frequencies
 * ranging from 8192Hz to 2Hz. If I had the energy, I'd somehow fix
 * it so that at startup, the timer code in sched.c would select
 * using either the RTC or the 8253 timer. The decision would be
 * based on whether there was any other device around that needed
 * to trample on the 8253. I'd set up the RTC to interrupt at 1024 Hz,
 * and then do some jiggery to have a version of do_timer that 
 * advanced the clock by 1/1024 s. Every time that reached over 1/100
 * of a second, then do all the old code. If the time was kept correct
 * then do_gettimeoffset could just return 0 - there is no low order
 * divider that can be accessed.
 *
 * Ideally, you would be able to use the RTC for the speaker driver,
 * but it appears that the speaker driver really needs interrupt more
 * often than every 120 us or so.
 *
 * Anyway, this needs more thought....		pjsg (1993-08-28)

 * 'real time' but nothing will break.
 * The most frequent case is that the CPU is "woken" from a halt
 * state by the timer interrupt itself, so we get 0 error. In the
 * rare cases where a driver would "wake" the CPU and request a
 * timestamp, the maximum error is < 1 jiffy. But timestamps are
 * still perfectly ordered.
 * Note that the TSC counter will be reset if APM suspends
 * to disk; this won't break the kernel, though, 'cuz we're
 * smart.  See arch/i386/kernel/apm.c.
