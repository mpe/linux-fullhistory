config IA64
	bool

	  The Itanium Processor Family is Intel's 64-bit successor to
	  the 32-bit X86 line.  The IA-64 Linux project has a home
	  page at <http://www.linuxia64.org/> and a mailing list at
	  <linux-ia64@vger.kernel.org>.

	select ACPI_NUMA
	select VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP
	select DISCONTIGMEM
	help
	  This selects the system type of your hardware.  A "generic" kernel
	  will run on any supported IA-64 system.  However, if you configure
	  a kernel for your specific system, it will be faster and smaller.

	  generic	 For any supported IA-64 system
	  DIG-compliant	 For DIG ("Developer's Interface Guide") compliant systems
	  HP-zx1/sx1000	 For HP systems
	  SGI-SN2	 For SGI Altix systems
	  Ski-simulator  For the HP simulator <http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/ski/>

	  If you don't know what to do, choose "generic".

config IA64_DIG
	bool "DIG-compliant"

config IA64_HP_ZX1
	bool "HP-zx1/sx1000"
	help
	  Build a kernel that runs on HP zx1 and sx1000 systems.  This adds
	  support for the HP I/O MMU.

config IA64_SGI_SN2
	bool "SGI-SN2"
	help
	  Selecting this option will optimize the kernel for use on sn2 based
	  systems, but the resulting kernel binary will not run on other
	  types of ia64 systems.  If you have an SGI Altix system, it's safe
	  to select this option.  If in doubt, select ia64 generic support
	  instead.

config IA64_HP_SIM
	bool "Ski-simulator"

choice
	prompt "Processor type"
	default ITANIUM

config ITANIUM
	bool "Itanium"
	help
	  Select your IA-64 processor type.  The default is Itanium.
	  This choice is safe for all IA-64 systems, but may not perform
	  optimally on systems with, say, Itanium 2 or newer processors.

config MCKINLEY
	bool "Itanium 2"
	help
	  Select this to configure for an Itanium 2 (McKinley) processor.

endchoice

choice
	prompt "Kernel page size"
	default IA64_PAGE_SIZE_16KB

config IA64_PAGE_SIZE_4KB
	bool "4KB"
	help
	  This lets you select the page size of the kernel.  For best IA-64
	  performance, a page size of 8KB or 16KB is recommended.  For best
	  IA-32 compatibility, a page size of 4KB should be selected (the vast
	  majority of IA-32 binaries work perfectly fine with a larger page
	  size).  For Itanium 2 or newer systems, a page size of 64KB can also
	  be selected.

	  4KB                For best IA-32 compatibility
	  8KB                For best IA-64 performance
	  16KB               For best IA-64 performance
	  64KB               Requires Itanium 2 or newer processor.

	  If you don't know what to do, choose 16KB.

	bool "Itanium B-step specific code"
	depends on ITANIUM
	help
	  Select this option to build a kernel for an Itanium prototype system
	  with a B-step CPU.  You have a B-step CPU if the "revision" field in
	  /proc/cpuinfo has a value in the range from 1 to 4.

config NUMA
	bool "NUMA support"
	depends on !IA64_HP_SIM
	default y if IA64_SGI_SN2
	help
	  Say Y to compile the kernel to support NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory
	  Access).  This option is for configuring high-end multiprocessor
	  server systems.  If in doubt, say N.

config VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP
	bool "Virtual mem map"
	default y if !IA64_HP_SIM
	help
	  Say Y to compile the kernel with support for a virtual mem map.
	  This code also only takes effect if a memory hole of greater than
	  1 Gb is found during boot.  You must turn this option on if you
	  require the DISCONTIGMEM option for your machine. If you are
	  unsure, say Y.

config DISCONTIGMEM
	bool "Discontiguous memory support"
	depends on (IA64_DIG || IA64_SGI_SN2 || IA64_GENERIC || IA64_HP_ZX1) && NUMA && VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP
	default y if (IA64_SGI_SN2 || IA64_GENERIC) && NUMA
	help
	  Say Y to support efficient handling of discontiguous physical memory,
	  for architectures which are either NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access)
	  or have huge holes in the physical address space for other reasons.
	  See <file:Documentation/vm/numa> for more.

config IA64_CYCLONE
	bool "Cyclone (EXA) Time Source support"
	help
	  Say Y here to enable support for IBM EXA Cyclone time source.
	  If you're unsure, answer N.

config IOSAPIC
	bool
	depends on !IA64_HP_SIM
	default y

config IA64_SGI_SN_SIM
	bool "SGI Medusa Simulator Support"
	depends on IA64_SGI_SN2
	help
	  If you are compiling a kernel that will run under SGI's IA-64
	  simulator (Medusa) then say Y, otherwise say N.

config FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER
	int
	default "18"

config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	help
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, say N.  If you have a system with more
	  than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  systems, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor system.  If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  single processor systems.  On a single processor system, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  See also the <file:Documentation/smp.txt> and the SMP-HOWTO
	  available at <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

config NR_CPUS
	int "Maximum number of CPUs (2-512)"
	range 2 512
	depends on SMP
	default "64"
	help
	  You should set this to the number of CPUs in your system, but
	  keep in mind that a kernel compiled for, e.g., 2 CPUs will boot but
	  only use 2 CPUs on a >2 CPU system.  Setting this to a value larger
	  than 64 will cause the use of a CPU mask array, causing a small
	  performance hit.

config HOTPLUG_CPU
    bool "Support for hot-pluggable CPUs (EXPERIMENTAL)"
    depends on SMP && HOTPLUG && EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
    ---help---
      Say Y here to experiment with turning CPUs off and on.  CPUs
      can be controlled through /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#.
      Say N if you want to disable CPU hotplug.

config PREEMPT
	bool "Preemptible Kernel"
        help
          This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
          real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
          be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
          This allows applications to run more reliably even when the system is
          under load.

          Say Y here if you are building a kernel for a desktop, embedded
          or real-time system.  Say N if you are unsure.

config HAVE_DEC_LOCK
	bool
	depends on (SMP || PREEMPT)
	default y

config IA32_SUPPORT
	bool "Support for Linux/x86 binaries"
	help
	  IA-64 processors can execute IA-32 (X86) instructions.  By
	  saying Y here, the kernel will include IA-32 system call
	  emulation support which makes it possible to transparently
	  run IA-32 Linux binaries on an IA-64 Linux system.
	  If in doubt, say Y.

config COMPAT
	bool
	depends on IA32_SUPPORT
	default y

config IA64_MCA_RECOVERY
	tristate "MCA recovery from errors other than TLB."

config PERFMON
	bool "Performance monitor support"
	help
	  Selects whether support for the IA-64 performance monitor hardware
	  is included in the kernel.  This makes some kernel data-structures a
	  little bigger and slows down execution a bit, but it is generally
	  a good idea to turn this on.  If you're unsure, say Y.

config IA64_PALINFO
	tristate "/proc/pal support"
	help
	  If you say Y here, you are able to get PAL (Processor Abstraction
	  Layer) information in /proc/pal.  This contains useful information
	  about the processors in your systems, such as cache and TLB sizes
	  and the PAL firmware version in use.

	  To use this option, you have to ensure that the "/proc file system
	  support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) is enabled, too.

menu "Power management and ACPI"

config PM
	bool "Power Management support"
	depends on IA64_GENERIC || IA64_DIG || IA64_HP_ZX1
	default y
	help
	  "Power Management" means that parts of your computer are shut
	  off or put into a power conserving "sleep" mode if they are not
	  being used.  There are two competing standards for doing this: APM
	  and ACPI.  If you want to use either one, say Y here and then also
	  to the requisite support below.

	  Power Management is most important for battery powered laptop
	  computers; if you have a laptop, check out the Linux Laptop home
	  page on the WWW at <http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/> and the
	  Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that, even if you say N here, Linux on the x86 architecture
	  will issue the hlt instruction if nothing is to be done, thereby
	  sending the processor to sleep and saving power.

	bool "PCI support"
	help
	  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
	  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
	  your box. Other bus systems are ISA, EISA, MicroChannel (MCA) or
	  VESA. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

	  The PCI-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, contains valuable
	  information about which PCI hardware does work under Linux and which
	  doesn't.
