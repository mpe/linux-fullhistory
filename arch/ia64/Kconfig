	---help---
	  ACPI/OSPM support for Linux is currently under development. As such,
	  this support is preliminary and EXPERIMENTAL.  Configuring ACPI
	  support enables kernel interfaces that allow higher level software
	  (OSPM) to manipulate ACPI defined hardware and software interfaces,
	  including the evaluation of ACPI control methods.  If unsure, choose
	  N here.  Note, this option will enlarge your kernel by about 120K.

	  This support requires an ACPI compliant platform (hardware/firmware).
	  If both ACPI and Advanced Power Management (APM) support are
	  configured, whichever is loaded first shall be used.

	  This code DOES NOT currently provide a complete OSPM implementation
	  -- it has not yet reached APM's level of functionality.  When fully
	  implemented, Linux ACPI/OSPM will provide a more robust functional
	  replacement for legacy configuration and power management
	  interfaces, including the Plug-and-Play BIOS specification (PnP
	  BIOS), the Multi-Processor Specification (MPS), and the Advanced
	  Power Management specification (APM).

	  Linux support for ACPI/OSPM is based on Intel Corporation's ACPI
	  Component Architecture (ACPI CA). The latest ACPI CA source code,
	  documentation, debug builds, and implementation status information
	  can be downloaded from:
	  <http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm>.

	  option is not supported on machines with the ZX1 chipset, this is
	  the only way of supporting more than 1 Gb of memory on those
	  machines. This code also only takes effect if a memory hole of

	  "Power Management" means that parts of your computer are shut
	  off or put into a power conserving "sleep" mode if they are not
	  being used.  There are two competing standards for doing this: APM
	  and ACPI.  If you want to use either one, say Y here and then also

	  Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that, even if you say N here, Linux on the x86 architecture
	  will issue the hlt instruction if nothing is to be done, thereby

# On IA-64, we always want an ELF /proc/kcore.
config KCORE_ELF
	bool

	---help---
	  If you enabled support for /proc file system then the file
	  /proc/kcore will contain the kernel core image. This can be used
	  in gdb:

	  $ cd /usr/src/linux ; gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore

	  You have two choices here: ELF and A.OUT. Selecting ELF will make
	  /proc/kcore appear in ELF core format as defined by the Executable
	  and Linking Format specification. Selecting A.OUT will choose the
	  old "a.out" format which may be necessary for some old versions
	  of binutils or on some architectures.

	  This is especially useful if you have compiled the kernel with the
	  "-g" option to preserve debugging information. It is mainly used
	  for examining kernel data structures on the live kernel so if you

config PREEMPT
	bool "Preemptible Kernel"
        help
          This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
          real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
          be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
          This allows applications to run more reliably even when the system is
          under load.

config PERFMON
	bool "Performance monitor support"
	help
	  Selects whether support for the IA-64 performance monitor hardware

	  a good idea to turn this on.  If you're unsure, say Y.

config IA64_PALINFO

	help
	  If you say Y here, you are able to get PAL (Processor Abstraction
	  Layer) information in /proc/pal.  This contains useful information
	  about the processors in your systems, such as cache and TLB sizes
	  and the PAL firmware version in use.

	  To use this option, you have to ensure that the "/proc file system

	  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and
	  executables used across different architectures and operating
	  systems. Saying Y here will enable your kernel to run ELF binaries.

	  Information about ELF is contained in the ELF HOWTO available from

	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to plug wrapper-driven binary
	  formats into the kernel. You will like this especially when you use
	  programs that need an interpreter to run like Java, Python or
	  Emacs-Lisp.  Once you have registered such a binary class with the
	  kernel, you can start one of those programs simply by typing in its
	  name at a shell prompt; Linux will automatically feed it to the
	  correct interpreter.

	  You can do other nice things, too. Read the file
	  <file:Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt> to learn how to use this
	  feature, and <file:Documentation/java.txt> for information about how
	  to include Java support.

	  You must say Y to "/proc file system support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) to
	  use this part of the kernel.

	  You may say M here for module support and later load the module when

	  storage units such as ATA/(E)IDE and ATAPI units. The most common
	  cases are IDE hard drives and ATAPI CD-ROM drives.

	  If your system is pure SCSI and doesn't use these interfaces, you
	  can say N here.

	  Integrated Disk Electronics (IDE aka ATA-1) is a connecting standard
	  for mass storage units such as hard disks. It was designed by
	  Western Digital and Compaq Computer in 1984. It was then named
	  ST506. Quite a number of disks use the IDE interface.

	  AT Attachment (ATA) is the superset of the IDE specifications.
	  ST506 was also called ATA-1.

	  Fast-IDE is ATA-2 (also named Fast ATA), Enhanced IDE (EIDE) is
	  ATA-3. It provides support for larger disks (up to 8.4GB by means of
	  the LBA standard), more disks (4 instead of 2) and for other mass
	  storage units such as tapes and cdrom. UDMA/33 (aka UltraDMA/33) is
	  ATA-4 and provides faster (and more CPU friendly) transfer modes
	  than previous PIO (Programmed processor Input/Output) from previous
	  ATA/IDE standards by means of fast DMA controllers.

	  ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) is a protocol used by EIDE tape and
	  CD-ROM drives, similar in many respects to the SCSI protocol.

	  SMART IDE (Self Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) was
	  designed in order to prevent data corruption and disk crash by
	  detecting pre hardware failure conditions (heat, access time, and
	  the like...). Disks built since June 1995 may follow this standard.
	  The kernel itself don't manage this; however there are quite a
	  number of user programs such as smart that can query the status of
	  SMART parameters disk.

	  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module

	  than an occasional beep, say Y.  Be sure to have all the information
	  about your sound card and its configuration down (I/O port,
	  interrupt and DMA channel), because you will be asked for it.

	  You want to read the Sound-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>. General information about
	  the modular sound system is contained in the files
	  <file:Documentation/sound/Introduction>.  The file
	  <file:Documentation/sound/README.OSS> contains some slightly
	  outdated but still useful information as well.

config DEBUG_KERNEL
	bool "Kernel debugging"
	help
	  Say Y here if you are developing drivers or trying to debug and
	  identify kernel problems.

config KALLSYMS
	bool "Load all symbols for debugging/kksymoops"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here to let the kernel print out symbolic crash information and
	  symbolic stack backtraces. This increases the size of the kernel
	  somewhat, as all symbols have to be loaded into the kernel image.

config IA64_PRINT_HAZARDS
	bool "Print possible IA-64 dependency violations to console"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Selecting this option prints more information for Illegal Dependency
	  Faults, that is, for Read-after-Write (RAW), Write-after-Write (WAW),
	  or Write-after-Read (WAR) violations.  This option is ignored if you
	  are compiling for an Itanium A step processor
	  (CONFIG_ITANIUM_ASTEP_SPECIFIC).  If you're unsure, select Y.

config DISABLE_VHPT
	bool "Disable VHPT"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  The Virtual Hash Page Table (VHPT) enhances virtual address
	  translation performance.  Normally you want the VHPT active but you
	  can select this option to disable the VHPT for debugging.  If you're
	  unsure, answer N.

config MAGIC_SYSRQ
	bool "Magic SysRq key"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will have some control over the system even
	  if the system crashes for example during kernel debugging (e.g., you
	  will be able to flush the buffer cache to disk, reboot the system
	  immediately or dump some status information). This is accomplished
	  by pressing various keys while holding SysRq (Alt+PrintScreen). It
	  also works on a serial console (on PC hardware at least), if you
	  send a BREAK and then within 5 seconds a command keypress. The
	  keys are documented in <file:Documentation/sysrq.txt>. Don't say Y
	  unless you really know what this hack does.

config IA64_EARLY_PRINTK
	bool "Early printk support"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Selecting this option uses the VGA screen or serial console for
	  printk() output before the consoles are initialised.  It is useful
	  for debugging problems early in the boot process, but only if you
	  have a suitable VGA/serial console attached.  If you're unsure,
	  select N.

config DEBUG_SLAB
	bool "Debug memory allocations"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here to have the kernel do limited verification on memory
	  allocation as well as poisoning memory on free to catch use of freed
	  memory.

config DEBUG_SPINLOCK
	bool "Spinlock debugging"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here and build SMP to catch missing spinlock initialization
	  and certain other kinds of spinlock errors commonly made.  This is
	  best used in conjunction with the NMI watchdog so that spinlock
	  deadlocks are also debuggable.

config DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP
	  bool "Sleep-inside-spinlock checking"
	  help
	    If you say Y here, various routines which may sleep will become very
	    noisy if they are called with a spinlock held.

config IA64_DEBUG_CMPXCHG
	bool "Turn on compare-and-exchange bug checking (slow!)"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Selecting this option turns on bug checking for the IA-64
	  compare-and-exchange instructions.  This is slow!  Itaniums
	  from step B3 or later don't have this problem. If you're unsure,
	  select N.

config IA64_DEBUG_IRQ
	bool "Turn on irq debug checks (slow!)"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Selecting this option turns on bug checking for the IA-64 irq_save
	  and restore instructions.  It's useful for tracking down spinlock
	  problems, but slow!  If you're unsure, select N.
