	---help---
	  This selects the system type of your hardware.  A "generic" kernel
	  will run on any supported IA-64 system.  However, if you configure
	  a kernel for your specific system, it will be faster and smaller.

	  To find out what type of IA-64 system you have, you may want to
	  check the IA-64 Linux web site at <http://www.linux-ia64.org/>.
	  As of the time of this writing, most hardware is DIG compliant,
	  so the "DIG-compliant" option is usually the right choice.

	  HP-simulator   For the HP simulator
	  (<http://software.hp.com/ia64linux/>).
	  HP-zx1         For HP zx1-based systems.
	  SGI-SN2	 For SGI Altix systems
	  DIG-compliant  For DIG ("Developer's Interface Guide") compliant
	  systems.

config ACPI
	bool

	default y
	---help---
	  ACPI/OSPM support for Linux is currently under development. As such,
	  this support is preliminary and EXPERIMENTAL.  Configuring ACPI
	  support enables kernel interfaces that allow higher level software
	  (OSPM) to manipulate ACPI defined hardware and software interfaces,
	  including the evaluation of ACPI control methods.  If unsure, choose
	  N here.  Note, this option will enlarge your kernel by about 120K.

	  This support requires an ACPI compliant platform (hardware/firmware).
	  If both ACPI and Advanced Power Management (APM) support are
	  configured, whichever is loaded first shall be used.

	  This code DOES NOT currently provide a complete OSPM implementation
	  -- it has not yet reached APM's level of functionality.  When fully
	  implemented, Linux ACPI/OSPM will provide a more robust functional
	  replacement for legacy configuration and power management
	  interfaces, including the Plug-and-Play BIOS specification (PnP
	  BIOS), the Multi-Processor Specification (MPS), and the Advanced
	  Power Management specification (APM).

	  Linux support for ACPI/OSPM is based on Intel Corporation's ACPI
	  Component Architecture (ACPI CA). The latest ACPI CA source code,
	  documentation, debug builds, and implementation status information
	  can be downloaded from:
	  <http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm>.

	  The ACPI Sourceforge project may also be of interest:

	  Select this option to build a kernel for an Itanium prototype system

	  Say Y to support efficient handling of discontiguous physical memory,
	  for architectures which are either NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access)
	  or have huge holes in the physical address space for other reasons.
	  See <file:Documentation/vm/numa> for more.

config VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP
	bool "Enable Virtual Mem Map"
	default y if !IA64_HP_SIM
	help
	  Say Y to compile the kernel with support for a virtual mem map.
	  This code also only takes effect if a memory hole of greater than
	  1 Gb is found during boot.  You must turn this option on if you
	  require the DISCONTIGMEM option for your machine. If you are
	  unsure, say Y.

config IA64_MCA
	bool "Enable IA-64 Machine Check Abort"
	default y if !IA64_HP_SIM

config PM
	bool "Power Management support"
	depends on IA64_GENERIC || IA64_DIG || IA64_HP_ZX1
	default y
	---help---
	  "Power Management" means that parts of your computer are shut
	  off or put into a power conserving "sleep" mode if they are not
	  being used.  There are two competing standards for doing this: APM
	  and ACPI.  If you want to use either one, say Y here and then also
	  to the requisite support below.

	  Power Management is most important for battery powered laptop
	  computers; if you have a laptop, check out the Linux Laptop home
	  page on the WWW at
	  <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/> and the
	  Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that, even if you say N here, Linux on the x86 architecture
	  will issue the hlt instruction if nothing is to be done, thereby
	  sending the processor to sleep and saving power.

config IOSAPIC

config IA64_PAL_IDLE
	bool "Use PAL_HALT_LIGHT in idle loop"
	---help---
	  Say Y here to enable use of PAL_HALT_LIGHT in the cpu_idle loop.
	  This allows the CPU to enter a low power state when idle.  You
	  can enable CONFIG_IA64_PALINFO and check /proc/pal/cpu0/power_info
	  to see the power consumption and latency for this state.  If you're
	  unsure your firmware supports it, answer N.

config SMP
	bool "SMP support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU say N. If you have a system with more than
	  one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  systems, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor system. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor system. On a singleprocessor system, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  See also the <file:Documentation/smp.tex>,
	  <file:Documentation/smp.txt>, and the SMP-HOWTO available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

config PREEMPT
	bool "Preemptible Kernel"
        help
          This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
          real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
          be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
          This allows applications to run more reliably even when the system is
          under load.

          Say Y here if you are building a kernel for a desktop, embedded
          or real-time system.  Say N if you are unsure.

config IA32_SUPPORT
	bool "Support running of Linux/x86 binaries"
	help
	  IA-64 processors can execute IA-32 (X86) instructions.  By
	  saying Y here, the kernel will include IA-32 system call
	  emulation support which makes it possible to transparently
	  run IA-32 Linux binaries on an IA-64 Linux system.
	  If in doubt, say Y.

config COMPAT

	default y

config HAVE_DEC_LOCK
	bool
	depends on (SMP || PREEMPT)
	default y

config PERFMON
	bool "Performance monitor support"
	help
	  Selects whether support for the IA-64 performance monitor hardware
	  is included in the kernel.  This makes some kernel data-structures a
	  little bigger and slows down execution a bit, but it is generally
	  a good idea to turn this on.  If you're unsure, say Y.

config IA64_PALINFO
	tristate "/proc/pal support"
	help
	  If you say Y here, you are able to get PAL (Processor Abstraction
	  Layer) information in /proc/pal.  This contains useful information
	  about the processors in your systems, such as cache and TLB sizes
	  and the PAL firmware version in use.

	  To use this option, you have to ensure that the "/proc file system
	  support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) is enabled, too.


config EFI
	bool
	depends on !IA64_HP_SIM
	default y

config EFI_VARS
	tristate "/proc/efi/vars support"
	help
	  If you say Y here, you are able to get EFI (Extensible Firmware
	  Interface) variable information in /proc/efi/vars.  You may read,
	  write, create, and destroy EFI variables through this interface.

	  To use this option, you have to check that the "/proc file system
	  support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) is enabled, too.

config NR_CPUS
	int "Maximum number of CPUs"
	depends on SMP
	default "64"
	help
	  You should set this to the number of CPUs in your system, but
	  keep in mind that a kernel compiled for, e.g., 2 CPUs will boot but
	  only use 2 CPUs on a >2 CPU system.  Setting this to a value larger
	  than 64 will cause the use of a CPU mask array, causing a small
	  performance hit.

config HOTPLUG
	bool "Support for hot-pluggable devices"
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to plug devices into your computer while
	  the system is running, and be able to use them quickly.  In many
	  cases, the devices can likewise be unplugged at any time too.

	  One well known example of this is PCMCIA- or PC-cards, credit-card
	  size devices such as network cards, modems or hard drives which are
	  plugged into slots found on all modern laptop computers.  Another
	  example, used on modern desktops as well as laptops, is USB.

	  Enable HOTPLUG and KMOD, and build a modular kernel.  Get agent
	  software (at <http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/>) and install it.
	  Then your kernel will automatically call out to a user mode "policy
	  agent" (/sbin/hotplug) to load modules and set up software needed
	  to use devices as you hotplug them.
