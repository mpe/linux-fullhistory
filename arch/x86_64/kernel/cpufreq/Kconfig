config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  Clock scaling allows you to change the clock speed of CPUs on the
	  fly. This is a nice method to save battery power on notebooks,
	  because the lower the clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  For more information, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>
	  or at <http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/cpufreq/>

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_TABLE
       tristate "CPU frequency table helpers"
       depends on CPU_FREQ
       default y
       help
         Many CPUFreq drivers use these helpers, so only say N here if
	 the CPUFreq driver of your choice doesn't need these helpers.

	 If in doubt, say Y.

config X86_POWERNOW_K8
	tristate "AMD Opteron/Athlon64 PowerNow!"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for mobile AMD Opteron/Athlon64 processors.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>. 

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_POWERNOW_K8_ACPI
	bool
	depends on ((X86_POWERNOW_K8 = "m" && ACPI_PROCESSOR) || (X86_POWERNOW_K8 = "y" && ACPI_PROCESSOR = "y"))
	default y

config X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO
	tristate "Intel Enhanced SpeedStep"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for Enhanced SpeedStep enabled
	  mobile CPUs.  This means Intel Pentium M (Centrino) CPUs
	  or 64bit enabled Intel Xeons.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO_TABLE
	bool
	depends on X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO
	default y

config X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO_ACPI
	bool "Use ACPI tables to decode valid frequency/voltage pairs (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	depends on ((X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO = "m" && ACPI_PROCESSOR) || (X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO = "y" && ACPI_PROCESSOR = "y"))
	help
	  Use primarily the information provided in the BIOS ACPI tables
	  to determine valid CPU frequency and voltage pairings.

	  If in doubt, say Y.

config X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ
	tristate "ACPI Processor P-States driver"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_TABLE && ACPI_PROCESSOR
	help
	  This driver adds a CPUFreq driver which utilizes the ACPI
	  Processor Performance States.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ_PROC_INTF
        bool "/proc/acpi/processor/../performance interface (deprecated)"
	depends on X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ && PROC_FS
	help
	  This enables the deprecated /proc/acpi/processor/../performance
	  interface. While it is helpful for debugging, the generic,
	  cross-architecture cpufreq interfaces should be used.

	  If in doubt, say N.
