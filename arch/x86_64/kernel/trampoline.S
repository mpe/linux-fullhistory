/*
 *
 *	Trampoline.S	Derived from Setup.S by Linus Torvalds
 *
 *	4 Jan 1997 Michael Chastain: changed to gnu as.
 *
 *	Entry: CS:IP point to the start of our code, we are 
 *	in real mode with no stack, but the rest of the 
 *	trampoline page to make our stack and everything else
 *	is a mystery.
 *
 *	In fact we don't actually need a stack so we don't
 *	set one up.
 *
 *	On entry to trampoline_data, the processor is in real mode
 *	with 16-bit addressing and 16-bit data.  CS has some value
 *	and IP is zero.  Thus, data addresses need to be absolute
 *	(no relocation) and are taken with regard to r_base.
 *
 *	If you work on this file, check the object module with objdump
 *	--full-contents --reloc to make sure there are no relocation
 *	entries. For the GDT entry we do hand relocation in smpboot.c
 *	because of 64bit linker limitations.
