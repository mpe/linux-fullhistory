	  The IM-PD1 is an add-on logic module for the Integrator which
	  allows ARM(R) Ltd PrimeCells to be developed and evaluated.
	  The IM-PD1 can be found on the Integrator/PP2 platform.

	  If you want to compile this as a module (=code which can be
	  inserted into and removed from the running kernel), say M
	  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
	  will be called impd1.
