	  S3C2410 DMA support. This is needed for drivers like sound which
	  use the S3C2410's DMA system to move data to and from the
	  peripheral blocks.

	  Enable debugging output for the DMA code. This option sends info
	  to the kernel log, at priority KERN_DEBUG.

	  Note, it is easy to create and fill the log buffer in a small
	  amount of time, as well as using an significant percantage of
	  the CPU time doing so.
