CONFIG_PLD_HOTSWAP
  This enables support for the dynamic loading and configuration of
  compatible drivers when the contents of the PLD are changed. This
  is still experimental and requires configuration tools which are
  not yet generally available. Say N here. You must enable the kernel
  module loader for this feature to work.
