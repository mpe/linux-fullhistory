This directory will contain the code necessary to compile and link the
/boot program which is necessary to boot on the Sparc.  This program
is real ugly and it knows too much.  It must be able to not only boot
off of the root partition but also be able to netboot.  This means
that it knows about RPC and NFS (bleech, yuck, eeewwwww!!) so that it
can remote mount the root directory to fetch the kernel.  Also it must
be able to ARP for it's IP address and who it's boot server is.  I
think I'm getting sick.

Regardless for now I will concentrate on the low-level stuff necessary
to get the thing going.  This means the low-level entry code, etc.
The prom knows how to get "us" if we have the proper boot blocks,
actually the boot blocks live in our logical partition on a hard drive
whereas over NFS this isn't applicable.  We have the boot blocks in
our data area either way because we can be dual purpose.

More will come....

Hopefully I can write this such that it will work on almost all SUN
machines in existance.  We'll see ;(
