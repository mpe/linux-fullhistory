	  One well known example of this is PCMCIA- or PC-cards, credit-card
	  size devices such as network cards, modems or hard drives which are
	  plugged into slots found on all modern laptop computers.  Another
	  example, used on modern desktops as well as laptops, is USB.

	  Enable HOTPLUG and KMOD, and build a modular kernel.  Get agent
	  software (at <http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/>) and install it.
	  Then your kernel will automatically call out to a user mode "policy
	  agent" (/sbin/hotplug) to load modules and set up software needed
	  to use devices as you hotplug them.

	  If you have a CD-ROM drive that is neither SCSI nor IDE/ATAPI, say Y
	  here, otherwise N. Read the CD-ROM-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about these CD-ROM drives. If you are unsure what you
	  have, say Y and find out whether you have one of the following
	  drives.

	  For each of these drivers, a file Documentation/cdrom/{driver_name}
	  exists. Especially in cases where you do not know exactly which kind
	  of drive you have you should read there. Most of these drivers use a
	  file drivers/cdrom/{driver_name}.h where you can define your
	  interface parameters and switch some internal goodies.

	  All these CD-ROM drivers are also usable as a module ( = code which
	  can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
	  want). If you want to compile them as module, say M instead of Y and
	  read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  If you want to use any of these CD-ROM drivers, you also have to
	  answer Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM file system support" below (this
	  answer will get "defaulted" for you if you enable any of the Linux
	  CD-ROM drivers).

	  than an occasional beep, say Y.  Be sure to have all the information
	  about your sound card and its configuration down (I/O port,
	  interrupt and DMA channel), because you will be asked for it.

	  You want to read the Sound-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>. General information about
	  the modular sound system is contained in the files
	  <file:Documentation/sound/Introduction>.  The file
	  <file:Documentation/sound/README.OSS> contains some slightly
	  outdated but still useful information as well.

	  If you have a PnP sound card and you want to configure it at boot
	  time using the ISA PnP tools (read
	  <http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/>), then you need to
	  compile the sound card support as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want)
	  and load that module after the PnP configuration is finished.  To do
	  this, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well
	  as <file:Documentation/sound/README.modules>; the module will be
	  called soundcore.

	  I'm told that even without a sound card, you can make your computer
	  say more than an occasional beep, by programming the PC speaker.
	  Kernel patches and supporting utilities to do that are in the pcsp
	  package, available at <ftp://ftp.infradead.org/pub/pcsp/>.
