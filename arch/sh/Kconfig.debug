config SH_STANDARD_BIOS
	bool "Use LinuxSH standard BIOS"
	help
	  Say Y here if your target has the gdb-sh-stub
	  package from www.m17n.org (or any conforming standard LinuxSH BIOS)
	  in FLASH or EPROM.  The kernel will use standard BIOS calls during
	  boot for various housekeeping tasks (including calls to read and
	  write characters to a system console, get a MAC address from an
	  on-board Ethernet interface, and shut down the hardware).  Note this
	  does not work with machines with an existing operating system in
	  mask ROM and no flash (WindowsCE machines fall in this category).
	  If unsure, say N.

config EARLY_SCIF_CONSOLE
	bool "Use early SCIF console"
	depends on CPU_SH4

config EARLY_PRINTK
	bool "Early printk support"
	depends on SH_STANDARD_BIOS || EARLY_SCIF_CONSOLE
	help
	  Say Y here to redirect kernel printk messages to the serial port
	  used by the SH-IPL bootloader, starting very early in the boot
	  process and ending when the kernel's serial console is initialised.
	  This option is only useful porting the kernel to a new machine,
	  when the kernel may crash or hang before the serial console is
	  initialised. If unsure, say N.

config KGDB
	bool "Include KGDB kernel debugger"
	help
	  Include in-kernel hooks for kgdb, the Linux kernel source level
	  debugger.  See <http://kgdb.sourceforge.net/> for more information.
	  Unless you are intending to debug the kernel, say N here.

config MORE_COMPILE_OPTIONS
	bool "Add any additional compile options"
	help
	  If you want to add additional CFLAGS to the kernel build, enable this
	  option and then enter what you would like to add in the next question.
	  Note however that -g is already appended with the selection of KGDB.

config FRAME_POINTER
	bool "Compile the kernel with frame pointers"
	default y if KGDB
	help
	  If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will be slightly larger
	  and slower, but it will give very useful debugging information.
	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N, but we may not be able
	  to solve problems without frame pointers.
