/*
 * Readahead design.
 *
 * The fields in struct file_ra_state represent the most-recently-executed
 * readahead attempt:
 *
 * start:	Page index at which we started the readahead
 * size:	Number of pages in that read
 *              Together, these form the "current window".
 *              Together, start and size represent the `readahead window'.
 * next_size:   The number of pages to read on the next readahead miss.
 * prev_page:   The page which the readahead algorithm most-recently inspected.
 *              prev_page is mainly an optimisation: if page_cache_readahead
 *		sees that it is again being called for a page which it just
 *		looked at, it can return immediately without making any state
 *		changes.
 * ahead_start,
 * ahead_size:  Together, these form the "ahead window".
 *
 * The readahead code manages two windows - the "current" and the "ahead"
 * windows.  The intent is that while the application is walking the pages
 * in the current window, I/O is underway on the ahead window.  When the
 * current window is fully traversed, it is replaced by the ahead window
 * and the ahead window is invalidated.  When this copying happens, the
 * new current window's pages are probably still locked.  When I/O has
 * completed, we submit a new batch of I/O, creating a new ahead window.
 *
 * So:
 *
 *   ----|----------------|----------------|-----
 *       ^start           ^start+size
 *                        ^ahead_start     ^ahead_start+ahead_size
 *
 *         ^ When this page is read, we submit I/O for the
 *           ahead window.
 *
 * A `readahead hit' occurs when a read request is made against a page which is
 * inside the current window.  Hits are good, and the window size (next_size)
 * is grown aggressively when hits occur.  Two pages are added to the next
 * window size on each hit, which will end up doubling the next window size by
 * the time I/O is submitted for it.
 *
 * If readahead hits are more sparse (say, the application is only reading
 * every second page) then the window will build more slowly.
 *
 * On a readahead miss (the application seeked away) the readahead window is
 * shrunk by 25%.  We don't want to drop it too aggressively, because it is a
 * good assumption that an application which has built a good readahead window
 * will continue to perform linear reads.  Either at the new file position, or
 * at the old one after another seek.
 *
 * There is a special-case: if the first page which the application tries to
 * read happens to be the first page of the file, it is assumed that a linear
 * read is about to happen and the window is immediately set to half of the
 * device maximum.
 * 
 * A page request at (start + size) is not a miss at all - it's just a part of
 * sequential file reading.
 *
 * This function is to be called for every page which is read, rather than when
 * it is time to perform readahead.  This is so the readahead algorithm can
 * centrally work out the access patterns.  This could be costly with many tiny
 * read()s, so we specifically optimise for that case with prev_page.
 */

/*
 * do_page_cache_readahead actually reads a chunk of disk.  It allocates all
 * the pages first, then submits them all for I/O. This avoids the very bad
 * behaviour which would occur if page allocations are causing VM writeback.
