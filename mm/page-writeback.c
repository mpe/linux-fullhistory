 * @mapping: address space structure to write
 * @nr_to_write: subtract the number of written pages from *@nr_to_write
 *
 * This is a library function, which implements the writeback_mapping()
 * address_space_operation for filesystems which are using multipage BIO
 * writeback.
 *
 * We need to be careful to avoid deadlocks here.  mpage_bio_writepage() does
 * not immediately start I/O against each page.  It waits until the bio is
 * full, or until mpage_bio_flush() is called.  So generic_writeback_mapping()
 * is locking multiple pages without necessarily starting I/O against them.
 *
 * AB/BA deadlocks are avoided via locking implemented in the filesystem.
 * Only one process ever has multiple locked pages against any mapping.
 *
 * FIXME: doing the locking in the fs is a bit grotty, but it allows us to
 * not have to put a new semaphore in struct inode.  The fs could
 * pass its bio_write_state up here, I guess.
 *
 * Pages can be moved from clean_pages or locked_pages onto dirty_pages
 * at any time - it's not possible to lock against that.  So pages which
 * have already been added to a BIO may magically reappear on the dirty_pages
 * list.  And generic_writeback_mapping() will again try to lock those pages.
 * But I/O has not yet been started agains the page.  Thus deadlock.
 *
 * To avoid this, the entire contents of the dirty_pages list are moved
 * onto io_pages up-front.  We then walk io_pages, locking the
 * pages and submitting them for I/O, moving them to locked_pages.
 *
 * This has the added benefit of preventing a livelock which would otherwise
 * occur if pages are being dirtied faster than we can write them out.
 *
 * Thus generic_writeback_mapping() only makes the guarantee that all pages
 * which were dirty at the time it was called will have I/O started against
 * them.  And it's not possible to make a stronger guarantee than that.
