 * to write out lots of pages around this one.  It allows extent-based
 * filesytems to do intelligent things.  It lets delayed-allocate filesystems
 * perform better file layout.  It lets the address_space opportunistically
 * write back disk-contiguous pages which are in other zones.
 *
 * FIXME: the VM wants to start I/O against *this* page.  Because its zone
 * is under pressure.  But this function may start writeout against a
 * totally different set of pages.  Unlikely to be a huge problem, but if it
 * is, we could just writepage the page if it is still (PageDirty &&
 * !PageWriteback) (See below).
 *
 * Another option is to just reposition page->mapping->dirty_pages so we
 * *know* that the page will be written.  That will work fine, but seems
 * unpleasant.  (If the page is not for-sure on ->dirty_pages we're dead).
 * Plus it assumes that the address_space is performing writeback in
 * ->dirty_pages order.
 *
 * So.  The proper fix is to leave the page locked-and-dirty and to pass
 * it all the way down.

 * @mapping: address space structure to write
 * @nr_to_write: subtract the number of written pages from *@nr_to_write
 *
 * This is a library function, which implements the writeback_mapping()
 * address_space_operation.
 *
 * (The next two paragraphs refer to code which isn't here yet, but they
 *  explain the presence of address_space.io_pages)
 *
 * Pages can be moved from clean_pages or locked_pages onto dirty_pages
 * at any time - it's not possible to lock against that.  So pages which
 * have already been added to a BIO may magically reappear on the dirty_pages
 * list.  And generic_writeback_mapping() will again try to lock those pages.
 * But I/O has not yet been started against the page.  Thus deadlock.
 *
 * To avoid this, the entire contents of the dirty_pages list are moved
 * onto io_pages up-front.  We then walk io_pages, locking the
 * pages and submitting them for I/O, moving them to locked_pages.
 *
 * This has the added benefit of preventing a livelock which would otherwise
 * occur if pages are being dirtied faster than we can write them out.
 *
 * If a page is already under I/O, generic_writeback_mapping() skips it, even
 * if it's dirty.  This is desirable behaviour for memory-cleaning writeback,
 * but it is INCORRECT for data-integrity system calls such as fsync().  fsync()
 * and msync() need to guarentee that all the data which was dirty at the time
 * the call was made get new I/O started against them.  The way to do this is
 * to run filemap_fdatawait() before calling filemap_fdatawrite().
 *
 * It's fairly rare for PageWriteback pages to be on ->dirty_pages.  It
 * means that someone redirtied the page while it was under I/O.
