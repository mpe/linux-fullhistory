 * description of effects of mapping type and prot in current implementation.

 * behavior is in parens:
 *
 * map_type	prot
 *		PROT_NONE	PROT_READ	PROT_WRITE	PROT_EXEC
 * MAP_SHARED	r: (no) yes	r: (yes) yes	r: (no) yes	r: (no) no
 *		w: (no) yes	w: (no) copy	w: (yes) yes	w: (no) no
 *		x: (no) no	x: (no) no	x: (no) no	x: (yes) no
 *		
 * MAP_PRIVATE	r: (no) yes	r: (yes) yes	r: (no) yes	r: (no) no
 *		w: (no) copy	w: (no) copy	w: (copy) copy	w: (no) no
 *		x: (no) no	x: (no) no	x: (no) no	x: (yes) no
 *
 * the permissions are encoded as cxwr (copy,exec,write,read)
