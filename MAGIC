This file is a registry of magic numbers which are in use.  When you
add a magic number to a structure, you should also add it to this
file, since it is best if the magic numbers used by various structures
are unique.

It is a *very* good idea to protect kernel data structures with magic
numbers.  This allows you to check at run time whether (a) a structure
has been clobbered, or (b) you've passed the wrong structure to a
routine.  This last is especially useful --- particlarly when you are
passing pointers to structures via a void * pointer.  The tty code,
for example, does this frequently to pass driver-specific and line
discipline-specific structures back and forth.

The way to use magic numbers is to declare then at the beginning of
the structure, like so:

struct tty_ldisc {
	int	magic;
	...
};

Please follow this discpline when you are adding future enhancements
to the kernel!  It has saved me countless hours of debugging,
especially in the screw cases where an array has been overrun and
structures following the array have been overwritten.  Using this
discpline, these cases get detected quickly and safely.
