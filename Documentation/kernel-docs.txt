    */

   The need for a document like this one became apparent in the
   linux-kernel mailing list as the same questions, asking for pointers
   to information, appeared again and again.
   
   Fortunately, as more and more people get to GNU/Linux, more and more
   get interested in the Kernel. But reading the sources is not always
   enough. It is easy to understand the code, but miss the concepts, the
   philosophy and design decissions behind this code.
   
   Unfortunately, not many documents are available for beginners to
   start. And, even if they exist, there was no "well-known" place which
   kept track of them. These lines try to cover this lack. All documents
   available on line known by the author are listed, while some reference
   books are also mentioned.
   
   PLEASE, if you know any paper not listed here or write a new document,
   send me an e-mail, and I'll include a reference to it here. Any
   corrections, ideas or comments are also welcomed.
   
   The papers that follow are listed in no particular order. All are
   catalogued with the following fields: the document's "Title", the
   "Author"/s, the "URL" where they can be found, some "Keywords"
   helpfull when searching for specific topics, and a brief "Description"
   of the Document.
   
   Enjoy!

            Description: On line, 200 pages book describing most
            aspects of the Linux Kernel. Probably, the first reference
            for beginners. Lots of illustrations explaining data
            structures use and relationships in the purest Richard W.
            Stevens' style. Contents: "1.-Hardware Basics, 2.-Software
            Basics, 3.-Memory Management, 4.-Processes, 5.-Interprocess
            Communication Mechanisms, 6.-PCI, 7.-Interrupts and Interrupt

            Description: No more Postscript book-like version. Only
            HTML now. Many people have contributed. The interface is
            similar to web available mailing lists archives. You can find
            some articles and then some mails asking questions about them
            and/or complementing previous contributions. A little bit
            anarchic in this aspect, but with some valuable information
            in some cases.

            practical limitations and constraints make this an
            ``interesting'' part of device driver writing, and several
            different facilities have been provided for different

            2.0.0, 2.1.101 etc.). With LSD you can search Linux kernel
            (fulltext, macros, types, functions and variables) and LSD
            can generate patches for you on the fly (files, directories
