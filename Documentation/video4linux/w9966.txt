W9966 Camera driver, written by Jakob Kemi (jakob.kemi@post.utfors.se)

Ok, after a lot of work in softice, wdasm, reading pdf-files
and trial-and-error work I've finally got everything to work.
Since I needed some vision for a robotics project I borrowed
this camera from a friend and started hacking. Anyway I've
converted my original code from the AVR 8bit RISC C/asm
into a working linux driver. I would really appreciate _any_
kind of feedback regarding this driver.

To get it working quickly configure your kernel
to support parport, ieee1284, video4linux, experimental drivers
and w9966

If w9966 is statically linked it will perform aggressive probing
for the camera. If built as a module you'll have more configuration options.

Options:
modprobe w9966.o pardev=parport0(or whatever) parmode=0 (0=auto, 1=ecp, 2=epp)
 
voila!

you can also type 'modinfo -p w9966.o' for option usage
(or checkout w9966.c)

I've only tested it with custom built testprograms
(http://hem.fyristorg.com/mogul/w9966.html) and with gqcam.
(you'll need to tweak the code to qcam a bit to make it work,
dimensions and such)

The slow framerate is due to missing DMA ECP read support in the 
parport drivers. I might add working EPP support later.

Good luck!
