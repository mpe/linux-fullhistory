Bttv is a device driver for frame grabber cards using the Bt848 family
of video decoder chips.
Among those are the Bt848, Bt848A, Bt849, Bt878 and Bt879.
The only major differences between the cards by different manufacturers 
are the types of tuners and extra components on the boards.
E.g., some cards by Hauppauge have an additional Videotext decoder 
and/or sound decoder chip.
Also type (Composite or S-VHS) and number of inputs differ.
Other Brooktree chips (e.g. the Bt829) or chips by other manufacturers 
(Philips, Zoran, ...) are NOT supported by bttv.

You can use several cards at the same time.
Interrupts can be shared with other Bt848 cards or any other drivers
which allow it.
The (arbitrary) maximum number of cards is 4 but can be adjusted by
changing BTTV_MAX at the beginning of bttv.c if you need more.
(But which board has more than 4 PCI slots plus 1 for the VGA card?)

Bttv is a standard component of all newer 2.1.x kernels.
This distribution additionally supports 2.0.x kernels and all other
changes and improvements which did not make it into the kernel version
yet. 
It also includes versions of videodev.c, i2.c, tuner.c and others
which are the same as in the latest 2.1.x kernel but with 2.0.x support.
A kernel version >2.0.30 is recommended.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Although bttv is now used and tested by many people it still might crash your
computer! Take all precautions to avoid data loss until you are certain
bttv runs on your setup without problems.
