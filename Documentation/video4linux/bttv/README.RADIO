Support is in now:
  - Turn on the "big red switch" of the sound processor.
  - two ioctls to access (some) registers of the sound processor.
  - a function in the TV-Widget which monitors the signal quality
    and does the mono/stereo switching.

So you should have TV with (stereo) sound now.  Radio does _not_ work.
It probably does not work with sat receivers. I can't test this and
therefore have not added support for it yet. If someone needs this and
can help testing the sat stuff, drop me a note.
