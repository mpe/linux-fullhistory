Suppported cards:


Bt848/Bt848a/Bt849/Bt878/Bt879 cards
------------------------------------

All cards with Bt848/Bt848a/Bt849/Bt878/Bt879 and normal Composite/S-VHS inputs
are supported.
Teletext and Intercast support (PAL only) for ALL cards via VBI sample decoding
in software.

Some cards with additional multiplexing of inputs are only partially 
supported (unless specifications by the card manufacturer are given).

All other cards only differ by additional components as tuners, sound decoders,
EEPROMs, teletext decoders ...


MATRIX Vision
-------------

MV-Delta
- Bt848A
- 4 Composite inputs, 1 S-VHS input (shared with 4th composite)
- EEPROM

http://www.matrix-vision.de/

This card has no tuner but supports all 4 composite (1 shared with an
S-VHS input) of the Bt848A.
Very nice card if you only have satellite TV but several tuners connected
to the card via composite.

Many thanks to Matrix-Vision for giving us 2 cards for free which made
Bt848a/Bt849 single crytal operation support possible!!!



Miro/Pinnacle PCTV
------------------

- Bt848 
  some (all??) come with 2 crystals for PAL/SECAM and NTSC 
- PAL, SECAM or NTSC TV tuner (Philips or TEMIC)
- MSP34xx sound decoder on add on board
  decoder is supported but AFAIK does not yet work 
  (other sound MUX setting in GPIO port needed??? somebody who fixed this???)
- 1 tuner, 1 composite and 1 S-VHS input
- tuner type is autodetected

Many thanks for the free card which made first NTSC support possible back
in 1997!


Hauppauge Win/TV pci
--------------------

There are many different versions of the Hauppauge cards with different 
tuners (TV+Radio ...), teletext decoders.
Note that even cards with same model numbers have (depending on the revision)
different chips on it.

- Bt848 (and others but always in 2 crystal operation???)
  newer cards have a Bt878
- PAL, SECAM, NTSC or tuner with or without Radio support

e.g.:
  PAL: 
  TDA5737: VHF, hyperband and UHF mixer/oscillator for TV and VCR 3-band tuners
  TSA5522: 1.4 GHz I2C-bus controlled synthesizer, I2C 0xc2-0xc3
  
  NTSC:
  TDA5731: VHF, hyperband and UHF mixer/oscillator for TV and VCR 3-band tuners
  TSA5518: no datasheet available on Philips site
- Philips SAA5246 or SAA5284 ( or no) Teletext decoder chip	
  with buffer RAM (e.g. Winbond W24257AS-35: 32Kx8 CMOS static RAM)
  SAA5246 (I2C 0x22) is supported
- 256 bytes EEPROM: Microchip 24LC02B or Philips 8582E2Y 
  with configuration information
  I2C address 0xa0 (24LC02B also responds to 0xa2-0xaf)
- 1 tuner, 1 composite and (depending on model) 1 S-VHS input
- 14052B: mux for selection of sound source
- sound decoder: TDA9800, MSP34xx (stereo cards) 


CPH-Series (CPH050, ...)
------------------------
Developed by TelSignal(?), OEMed by many vendors (Askey, Typhoon, 
  Anubis, Dynalink)

  Card series:
    CPH01x: BT848 capture only
    CPH03x: BT848
    CPH05x: BT878 with FM
    CPH06x: BT878 (w/o FM)
    CPH07x: BT878 capture only
 
  TV standards:
     CPH0x0: NTSC-M/M
     CPH0x1: PAL-B/G
     CPH0x2: PAL-I/I
     CPH0x3: PAL-D/K
     CPH0x4: SECAM-L/L 
     CPH0x5: SECAM-B/G 
     CPH0x6: SECAM-D/K 
     CPH0x7: PAL-N/N 
     CPH0x8: PAL-B/H 
     CPH0x9: PAL-M/M

  CPH03x was often sold as "TV capturer".

  Identifying:
  1) 878 cards can be identified by PCI Subsystem-ID:
      144f:3000 = CPH06x
      144F:3002 = CPH05x w/ FM
      144F:3005 = CPH06x_LC (w/o remote control)
  1) The cards have a sticker with "CPH"-model on the back.
  2) These cards have a number printed on the PCB just above the tuner metal box:
      "80-CP2000300-x" = CPH03X
      "80-CP2000500-x" = CPH05X
      "80-CP2000600-x" = CPH06X / CPH06x_LC

  Askey sells these cards as "Magic TView series", Brand "MagicXpress".
  Other OEM often call these "Tview", "TView99" or else.

Lifeview Flyvideo Series:
-------------------------
  The naming of these series differs in time and space.

  Identifying:
  1) Some models can be identified by PCI subsystem ID:
      1852:1852 = Flyvideo 98 FM
      1851:1850 = Flyvideo 98
      1851:1851 = Flyvideo 98 EZ (capture only)
  2) There is a print on the PCB:
      LR25       = Flyvideo (Zoran)
      LR37 Rev.C = Capture only (ZR36120 + SAA7110)
      LR50 Rev.Q = Flyvideo 98 (w/eeprom and PCI subsystem ID)
      LR50 Rev.W = Flyvideo 98 (no eeprom)
      LR51 Rev.E = Flyvideo 98 EZ (capture only)
      LR90       = Flyvideo 2000 series
      LR90 Rev.F = Lifetec/Medion LT 9815
      LR97       = Flyvideo DVBS

  "Flyvideo II" had been the name for the 848 cards, nowadays (in Germany)
  this name is re-used for LR50 Rev.W.
  The Lifeview website has even more names: Flyvideo III,2100,3000,3100.
  These cards are sold by many OEMs too.
