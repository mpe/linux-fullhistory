bttv.o
	the bt848 (grabber chip) driver

	insmod args:
		card=n		card type, see cardlist for a list.
		radio=0/1	card supports radio
		pll=0/1/2	pll settings
			0: don't use PLL
			1: 28 MHz crystal installed
			2: 35 MHz crystal installed
		triton1=0/1     for Triton1 compatibility
                                Triton1 is automatically recognized
                                but this might also help with other chipsets
		bigendian=n	Set the endianness of the gfx framebuffer.
				Default is native endian.
		fieldnr=0/1	Count fields.  Some TV descrambling software
				needs this, for others it only generates
				50 useless IRQs/sec.  default is 0 (off).
		autoload=0/1	autoload helper modules (tuner, audio).
				default is 1 (on).
		verbose=0/1/2	verbose level (at insmod time, while looking at
				the hardware).  default is 1.
		debug=0/1	debug messages (for capture).
				default is 0 (off).
		gbuffers=2-64	number of capture buffers for mmap'ed capture.
				default is 2.
                gbufsize=n      size of capture buffers. default and
                                maximum value is 0x208000 (~2MB)

	remap, card, radio and pll accept up to four comma-separated arguments
	(for multiple boards).

msp3400.o
	The driver for the msp34xx sound processor chips. If you have a
	stereo card, you probably want to insmod this one.

	insmod args:
		debug=1/2	print some debug info to the syslog,
				2 is more verbose.
		simple=1	Use the "short programming" method.  Newer
				msp34xx versions support this.  You need this
				for dbx stereo.
		once=1		Don't check the TV-stations Audio mode
				every few seconds, but only once after
				channel switches.
		amsound=1	Audio carrier is AM/NICAM at 6.5 Mhz.  This
				should improve things for french people, the
				carrier autoscan seems to work with FM only...
		mixer=n		allocate mixer device #n.  Default is the
				first free slot.

tea6300.o
	The driver for the tea6300 fader chip.  If you have a stereo
	card and the msp3400.o doesn't work, you might want to try this
	one.  This chip is seen on most STB TV/FM cards (usually from
	Gateway OEM sold surplus on auction sites).

	insmod args:
		debug=1		print some debug info to the syslog.

tda8425.o
	The driver for the tda8425 fader chip.  This driver used to be
	part of bttv.c, so if your sound used to work but does not
	anymore, try loading this module.

	insmod args:
		debug=1		print some debug info to the syslog.

tda985x.o
	The driver for the tda9850/55 audio chips.

	insmod args:
		debug=1		print some debug info to the syslog.
		chip=9850/9855	set the chip type.

tuner.o
	The tuner driver.  You need this unless you want to use only
	with a camera or external tuner ...

	insmod args:
		debug=1		print some debug info to the syslog
		type=n		type of the tuner chip. n as follows:
			0: Temic PAL tuner
			1: Philips PAL_I tuner
			2: Philips NTSC tuner
			3: Philips SECAM tuner
			4: no tuner
			5: Philips PAL tuner
			6: Temic NTSC tuner
			7: Temic PAL tuner
