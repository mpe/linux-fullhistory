		      may be ommitted indicating that they should retain
		      the default tag depth.
            Examples: tag_info:{{16,32,32,64,8,8,,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32}
			On Controller 0
			  specifies a tag depth of 16 for target 0
			  specifies a tag depth of 64 for target 3
			  specifies a tag depth of 8 for targets 4 and 5
			  leaves target 6 at the default

                      The rd_strm_bitmask is a 16 bit hex value in which
		      each bit represents a target.  Setting the target's
                      bit to '1' enables read streaming for that
                      target.  Controllers may be ommitted indicating that
		      they should retain the default read streaming setting.
	     Example: rd_strm:{0x0041}
			On Controller 0
			  enables read streaming for targets 0 and 6.
			  disables read streaming for targets 1-5,7-15.
			All other targets retain the default read
			streaming setting.
	     Example: rd_strm:{0x0023,,0xFFFF}
			On Controller 0
			  enables read streaming for targets 1,2, and 5.
			  disables read streaming for targets 3,4,6-15.
			On Controller 2
			  enables read streaming for all targets.
			All other targets retain the default read
			streaming setting.

4. Additional Notes

   4.1. Known/Unresolved or FYI Issues

	* Domain Validation is not implemented.
	* Under SuSE Linux Enterprise 7, the driver may fail to operate
	  correctly due to a problem with PCI interrupt routing in the
	  Linux kernel.  Please contact SuSE for an updated Linux
	  kernel.

   4.2. Third-Party Compatibility Issues

        * Adaptec only supports Ultra320 hard drives running
          the latest firmware available. Please check with
          your hard drive manufacturer to ensure you have the
          latest version.

   4.3. Operating System or Technology Limitations
        
        * PCI Hot Plug is untested and may cause the operating system 
          to stop responding.
