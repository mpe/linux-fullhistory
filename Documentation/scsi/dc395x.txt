README file for the dc395x SCSI driver
==========================================

Status
------
The driver has been tested with CD-R and CD-R/W drives. These should
be safe to use. Testing with hard disks has not been done to any
great degree and caution should be exercised if you want to attempt
to use this driver with hard disks.

This is a 2.5 only driver. For a 2.4 driver please see the original
driver (which this driver started from) at
http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/dc395/

Problems, questions and patches should be submitted to the mailing
list. Details on the list, including archives, are available at
http://lists.twibble.org/mailman/listinfo/dc395x/

Parameters
----------
The driver uses the settings from the EEPROM set in the SCSI BIOS 
setup. If there is no EEPROM, the driver uses default values.
Both can be overriden by command line parameters (module or kernel
parameters).

The syntax is as follows:
 dc395x = AdapterID, SpeedIdx, DevMode, AdaptMode, Tags, DelayReset

AdapterID : Host Adapter SCSI ID
SpeedIdx  : 0,1,...7 = 20,13.3,10,8,6.7,5.8,5,4 MHz               [ 7]
DevMode   : Bitmap for Dev Cfg                                    [63]
AdaptMode : Bitmap for Adapter Cfg                                [47]
Tags      : The number of tags is 1<<x, if x has been specified   [ 4]
DelayReset: The seconds to not accept commands after a SCSI Reset [ 1]

DevMode bit definition:
   Bit Val(hex) Val(dec)  Meaning
   *0	 0x01	    1	  Parity check
   *1	 0x02	    2	  Synchronous Negotiation
   *2	 0x04	    4	  Disconnection
   *3	 0x08	    8	  Send Start command on startup. (Not used)
   *4	 0x10	   16	  Tagged Command Queueing
   *5	 0x20	   32	  Wide Negotiation

AdaptMode bit definition
   Bit Val(hex) Val(dec)  Meaning
   *0	 0x01	    1	  Support more than two drives. (Not used)
   *1	 0x02	    2	  Use DOS compatible mapping for HDs greater than 1GB.
   *2	 0x04	    4	  Reset SCSI Bus on startup.
   *3	 0x08	    8	  Active Negation: Improves SCSI Bus noise immunity.
    4	 0x10	   16	  Immediate return on BIOS seek command. (Not used)
 (*)5	 0x20	   32	  Check for LUNs >= 1.

If you set AdapterID to -1, the adapter will use conservative
("safe") default settings instead; more precisely, dc395x=-1 is a
shortcut for dc395x=7,4,9,15,2,10

If you specify -2 for a value, it will be ignored. You don't need to
specify all six parameters.
