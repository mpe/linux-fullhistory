Intro
=====

This document contains a list of the latest releases of the most
important packages for Linux as well as instructions for newcomers to
the 1.3.x series of kernels.  By glancing through it, you should be
able to find out what you need to upgrade in order to successfully run
the latest kernels.

   It was originally based on material from the linux-kernel mailing
list, Jared Mauch's web page "Software Victims of the 1.3 Kernel
Development" (http://www2.nether.net/~jared/victim.html), and Axel
Boldt's (boldt@math.ucsb.edu) Configure.help file, among other sources,
and was originally written and maintained by Alessandro Sigala
(ssigala@globalnet.it).

   There is now a web page based on this material, thanks to John
Taylor.  Check out http://www.cviog.uga.edu/LinuxBleed.html if you
prefer a HTML-ized shopping list.

Upgrade notes
*************

Network errors with recent kernels
==================================

   Many default network scripts are set up to add a route to the
localhost at 127.0.0.1 at startup.  However, they do this incorrectly.
To fix the error, which is now spotted by the kernel (causing many
daemons to quit working), look for a line like `route add -net
127.0.0.1' in your network configuration files and change it to `route
add -net 127.0.0.0'.

   This error is present in all Red Hat distributions (and derivative
distributions like Caldera).  If you're running one of these, edit
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-lo, changing the line `route add
-net $(IPADDR)' to `route add -net 127.0.0.0' and you should be fine.

Booting Changes
===============

   The boot stuff in 1.3.x (for arch/i386) has been enhanced so that it
now can load bigger kernels (bzImage) and that the loaders now can load
an initial ramdisk (initrd). For initrd see Documentation/initrd.txt.
For building bigger kernels use one of the following make targets:
bzImage, bzlilo, bzdisk (equivalent to make targets zImage, zlilo, and
zdisk respectively).  If you want or need to use the new features
you'll need to upgrade your bootloaders.  Lilo can be found at
ftp://lrcftp.epfl.ch/pub/linux/local/lilo/lilo.19.tar.gz.  LOADLIN is at
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Linux-boot/lodlin16.tgz.  If
you're using more unusual loaders like SysLinux or etherboot, the
latest versions are 1.3 and 2.0, respectively.

The Linux C Library
===================

   The latest stable Linux C Library release is 5.2.18.  If you upgrade
to this from 5.0.9 or earlier, be sure to read the
`release.libc-5.2.18' file, since GNU make and a few other fairly
important utils can be broken by the upgrade.

   The current (beta) Linux C Library release is 5.3.12. In this
release there are some important changes that may cause troubles to
buggy programs (programs that call free() on a pointer not returned by
malloc() work with previous libc, but not with this release) so read the
`release.libc-5.3.9' file carefully!  In the latest libc releases a
dirent bug, which erroneously defined d->reclen to d->namlen if USE_GNU
was defined, has been fixed.  Unfortunately, some GNU packages depend
on this bug.  GNU make 3.xx is one of them.  To fix that you need to
patch and recompile those programs (a patch for make is included in the
file `release.libc-.5.3.9', and the address to obtain a precompiled
binary is at the end of this file).

   Also, the libc-5.3.x line has a known security hole relating to
rlogin.  Libc-5.3.12 fixes this, so if you're going to run an
experimental libc, be sure to upgrade to 5.3.12.

   If you're getting an error message that is something to the effect of

   `fcntl_setlk() called by process 123 with broken flock() emulation'

   then you need to upgrade to libc-5.2.18 as well.  A proper (in other
words, BSD-style ;-) flock system call was added in 1.3.x, and older
libc's will now give this error.  It doesn't *really* matter, so you
can just ignore it.  If it really annoys you, upgrade libc (and
recompile any static binaries you might have that are linked against
the old libc).  If you're feeling lazy, just comment out

   `                printk(KERN_WARNING
"fcntl_setlk() called by process %d with broken flock()
  emulation\n",                        current->pid);'

   in linux/fs/locks.c and recompile.  If you're still running a.out,
there's an unofficial libc-4.7.6 release out to which you can upgrade
to fix this problem.

The Termcap Library
===================

   The current Termcap release is 2.0.8. If you upgrade to this release
read the `README' file contained into the package to get some important
information about the `tgetent' function changes!

Procps utilities
================

   In the latest 1.3.x kernel releases the /proc file system structure
was changed, so you need to upgrade the procps package to version
0.99a.  In the very latest kernels, /proc has changed again.  There's
not yet an officially updated version of procps, so use 0.99a; you
might want to look for one of the patches floating around to update
0.99a for use with 1.3.94 and later kernels.

Kernel Modules
==============

   1.3.x is almost completely modularized, and kerneld is now
incorporated into the kernel.  To take advantage of this, you'll need
the latest version of the module support apps.  The latest non-beta is
modules-1.3.57.tar.gz, and the latest beta is modules-1.3.69k.tar.gz.
These should be available at the same place you picked up your kernel
(ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/kernel/src/) and the home page is
http://www.pi.se/blox/modules/index.html.  Note:  If you try to load a
module and get a message like

   `gcc2_compiled, undefined Failed to load module!  The symbols from
kernel 1.3.foo don't match 1.3.foo'

   where `foo' is a number for a recent kernel, then it's time to
upgrade module utilities from 1.3.57 to the latest beta 1.3.69; you'll
only get this error if you're running the latest binutils, so most
people don't need to upgrade past 1.3.57.

   Another little tip: you can't have both a.out *and* ELF support
compiled as modules.  Otherwise, you get a nice Catch-22 when you try
to run insmod to install a.out/ELF support so you can run insmod ;-).
If you have an all-ELF system, but need a.out for the occasional legacy
app, then you can do a.out support as a module.  Otherwise, you should
probably leave it in the kernel, and if you haven't gone ELF yet, you
can probably say no to ELF support.  Similarly, any partitions that you
have to mount at startup have to have their necessary file system and
device drivers compiled into the kernel, so don't get grandiose ideas
about going completely modular and then forget to compile ext2fs
support and ide drive support into your kernel ;-).

PPP driver
==========

   You need to be running a pppd from ppp-2.2.0.tar.gz or greater.  The
latest stable release is 2.2.0f and is available at
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Network/serial/ppp/ppp-2.2.0f.tar.gz.

Named pipes (SysVinit)
======================

   Linux's handling of named pipes changed (it now does it The Right Way
instead of the SunOS way ;-).  This broke some programs that depended
on the SunOS behavior, most notably SysVinit.  If you're running 2.59
or earlier, you will probably get a weird error on shutdown in which
your computer shuts down fine but "INIT: error reading initrequest" or
words to that effect scroll across your screen hundreds of times.  To
fix, upgrade to
ftp://ftp.cistron.nl/pub/people/miquels/debian/sysvinit-2.62.tar.gz.

   If you're trying to run NCSA httpd, you have to set pre-spawning of
daemons to zero, as it incorrectly assumes SunOS behavior.  I recommend
you just switch to Apache httpd.

   The new named pipe behavior also causes problems with Hylafax.  If
you're running the hylafax daemon, it will just keep eating up CPU time
until you have no idle time free.  To fix this, edit port.h included
with the Hylafax distribution and change the line

   CONFIG_OPENFIFO="O_RDONLY"

   to

   CONFIG_OPENFIFO="O_RDWR"

   A similar method (finding all named pipes opened read-only and
changing them to read-write) will fix any program that is broken
because of this change.

File Locking (Sendmail)
=======================

   As of pre2.0.6 (aka 1.99.6), mixed-style file locking is no longer
allowed.  For example, a file cannot be simultaneously locked with
`flock' and `fcntl'.  See Documentation/locks.txt for all the gory
details.  Among the programs this has impacted are older sendmails.  If
you get a message that sendmail cannot lock aliases.dir (or other
files), you'll need to upgrade to at least 8.7.x. The latest sendmail
is at ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/src/sendmail/sendmail.8.7.5.tar.gz.

Uugetty
=======

   Older uugettys will not allow use of a bidirectional serial line.  To
fix this problem, upgrade to
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Serial/getty_ps-2.0.7h.tar.gz.

Kbd
===

   For those of you needing non-ASCII character/font support, you should
upgrade to ftp.funet.fi:/pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/kbd-0.91.tar.gz.

Console
=======

   The Linux console type has changed.  If your setup is old enough
that you have problems, you'll need to update your termcap.  To fix,
add linux to one of the types in /etc/termcap or snoop around
http://www.ccil.org/~esr/ncurses.html (reputedly the latest universal
termcap maintainer).  You may also need to update terminfo by running
the following as root:

   ln -s /usr/lib/terminfo/l/linux /usr/lib/terminfo/c/console

   Better yet, just get the latest official Linux termcap from
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/GCC/termcap-2.0.8.tar.gz

   Also, the console driver is now responsible for keeping track of
correspondence between character codes and glyph bitmaps.  If you
encounter problems, try `loadunimap def' to get back the default
correspondence.

Hdparm
======

   Hdparm has been upgraded to take advantage of the latest features of
the kernel drivers.  The latest non-beta version can be found at
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/diskdrives/hdparm-2.7.tar.gz.

IP Accounting
=============

   All IP packets coming in or going out via one of the network
interfaces are now passing the accounting chain.  So, packets being
forwarded are passing this chain twice.  Since pre2.0.7 (aka 1.99.7),
accounting rules can be defined so that they will only match in one
direction (either incoming or outgoing).

   There also exists a possibility to match on device names and/or
device addresses, so that only packets coming in/going out via that
device (network interface) match with a rule.  You'll need to get
ipfwadm from ftp://ftp.xos.nl/pub/linux/ipfwadm/ipfwadm-2.1.tar.gz to
use this.

IP Firewalls
============

   The IP firewall code has been changed drastically during 1.3.x.
There are now 3 categories of firewall rules: one for incoming packets,
one for outgoing packets, and one for packets being forwarded.  There
also exists a possibility to match on device names and/or device
addresses, so that only packets coming in/going out via that device
(network interface) match with a rule.  This is especially useful to
prevent spoofing.  You'll need to get
ftp://ftp.xos.nl/pub/linux/ipfwadm/ipfwadm-2.1.tar.gz to use this.

IP Masquerading
===============

   IP masquerading is now part of the standard kernel.  However, you
always need to load separate modules (ip_masq_ftp.o and/or
ip_masq_irc.o) if you are going to use FTP or IRC in combination with
masquerading.  You'll need to get
ftp://ftp.xos.nl/pub/linux/ipfwadm/ipfwadm-2.1.tar.gz to use this.

ISDN support
============

   The new kernels support ISDN.  You'll need ISDN utils available from
ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/isdn4linux/isdn4k-utils-1.3.97.tar.gz to try
this.

Term is broken
==============

   Term (a comm line multiplexer similar in purpose to slirp) does not
work with kernels later than 1.3.60.  Since the author of term is
apparently currently on vacation, there is no fix forthcoming.  I
suggest that those of you who rely on term learn to use slirp.

Networking
==========

   Some of the /proc/net entries have changed.  You'll need to upgrade
to the latest net-tools in
ftp://ftp.inka.de:/pub/comp/Linux/networking/net-tools.  The last
official release there is net-tools-1.2.0.tar.gz, and the latest
release is net-tools-1.32-alpha.tar.gz.  If you need the upgrade, you
probably need the latest beta release.

Xntpd
=====

   Older versions of xntpd will not work with the latest kernels.
Upgrade to xntp3.5f.tar.Z, available from
ftp://louie.udel.edu/pub/ntp/xntp3.5f.tar.Z.

Sound driver
============

   The sound driver was upgraded in the 1.3.x kernels, breaking vplay.
To fix this problem, get a new version of the sndkit from
ftp://ftp.best.com/pub/front/tasd/snd-util-3.5.tar.gz.  Some users
report that various other sound utils (cdd2wav-sbpcd, for example) need
to be recompiled before they will work with the new kernels.

Tcsh
====

   If tcsh acts funny, get the source from
ftp://anise.ee.cornell.edu/pub/tcsh and add #define SYSMALLOC in
config_f.h before recompiling tcsh.  Binaries can be found in
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Shells/ and a corrected one will
probably wind up there eventually.

Make
====

   If make no longer works, you need to read the release notes for the
libc you upgraded to.  The latest libc and release notes can be found at
ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/GCC.  This is NOT an error due
to the kernel, though many people have mistakenly thought it is.  When
you upgrade to libc-5.3.9, you have to patch make to get it to work.
All of this is documented in the release notes with libc.  Upgrading
libc can also break xterm support.  If it does, you need to recompile
xterm.

Loop device
===========

   1.3.x kernels include loop device support which lets you mount a
file as a file system, which can allow for all sorts of cool things
like encrypted file systems and such.  To use it, you'll need a
modified version of mount from
ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux/util/mount-2.5X.tar.gz and preliminary
work on encrypted file system support can be found in
ftp.funet.fi:/pub/OS/Linux/BETA/loop/des.1.tar.gz.

Multiple device
===============

   Multiple device support (allowing you to group several partitions
into one logical device) has also been added.  Check out
ftp://sweet-smoke.ufr-info-p7.ibp.fr/pub/Linux/md034.tar.gz to try this
out.

Arp
===

   Arp daemon support has been added.  Check out
http://www.loran.com/~layes/arpd/index.html for more info and a copy of
arpd.

Quota
=====

   Quota support has also been added.  You need to get quotas-1.51 from
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/subsystems/quota/all.tar.gz.
This will compile just fine after you copy its mntent.h over to
/usr/include/mntent.h.  I've uploaded this to sunsite as
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Admin/quotas-1.51-tar.gz

Process Accounting
==================

   Process accounting support has also been integrated into the new
kernels. To use this feature, you'll need to get
ftp://iguana.hut.fi/pub/linux/Kernel/process_accounting/acct_1.3.73.tar.gz.

Bdflush
=======

   Bdflush has also been integrated into the new kernels, so those of
you using it on older systems no longer need to hunt for the patches to
implement it once you upgrade to 1.3.x.

APM support
===========

   Advanced Power Management (APM) support has been added to the kernel
as well.  APM, which is primarily of use in laptops, provides access to
battery status information and may help to conserve battery power.  The
support files can be found in
ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/laptops/apm/apmd-2.4.tar.gz

iBCS and Dosemu
===============

   For a version of iBCS that works with 1.3.x kernels, grab
ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/BETA/ibcs2/ibcs-1.3-960404-ALPHA.tar.gz

   For a version of Dosemu that works (well, at least as well as DOS
ever works ;-), get
ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu/Development/dosemu-0.63.1.19.tgz.
Be sure to follow the instructions in README.newkernels about patching
your include files, or it will not compile.

Mtools and Fdutils
==================

   The floppy ioctl numbering scheme has changed in 1.3.x.  For
backwards compatibility, the old system was supported through 1.3.x and
will generate a warning in 2.0.  In 2.1.x, the old scheme will
disappear entirely.

   To avoid trouble (or at least annoying messages), you'll need to
recompile any programs which emit floppy ioctls, including mtools and
fdutils.  For mtools, get
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/disk-management/mtools-3.0.src.tar.gz
and for fdutils, get
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Misc/fdutils-4.3.src.tar.gz.

   In the future, fdformat might disappear entirely, so get used to
using superformat instead.

How to know the version of the installed programs
*************************************************

   There are some simple methods useful to know the version of the
installed programs and libraries.

GNU CC: gcc -v and gcc --version
PPP: pppd -h (wrong but it show the version)
Libc: ls -l /lib/libc.so.5
Libc++: ls -l /usr/lib/libg++.so
Binutils: ld -v
ldd: ldd -v and ldd -V
termcap: ls -l /lib/libtermcap.so.*
modules: insmod -V

Other Info
==========

   Please remember that most of these utils are available on your
favorite local linux mirror.  If you can, please get them from a closer
site before checking sunsite.

   Also, for those of you running Red Hat (or RPM on a different
distribution), most of these are available in RPM format.  Check around
your favorite Red Hat mirror site before installing the non-RPM
version.  Remember, you might need to use the -force option to get the
upgrade to install.

Please send info about any other packages that 1.3.x "broke" or about
any new features of 1.3.x that require extra or new packages for use to
Chris Ricker (gt1355b@prism.gatech.edu).  I generate this from a
modified texinfo setup, so you don't need to bother generating a diff
against the current version before you send the additional information
to me.
