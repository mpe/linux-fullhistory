			S3C24XX ARM Linux Overview
			==========================



Introduction
------------

  The Samsung S3C24XX range of ARM9 System-on-Chip CPUs are supported
  by the 's3c2410' architecture of ARM Linux. Currently the S3C2410 is
  the only supported CPU in this range.


Configuration
-------------

  A generic S3C2410 configuration is provided, and can be used as the
  default by `make s3c2410_defconfig`. This configuration has support
  for all the machines, and the commonly used features on them.

  Certain machines may have their own default configurations as well,
  please check the machine specific documentation.


Machines
--------

  The currently supported machines are as follows:

  Simtec Electronics EB2410ITX (BAST)

    A general purpose development board, see EB2410ITX.txt for further
    details

  Samsung SMDK2410

    Samsung's own development board, geared for PDA work.

  Thorcom VR1000

    Custom embedded board

  HP IPAQ 1940

    Handheld (IPAQ), available in several varieties


NAND
----

  The current kernels do not have direct support for the NAND
  controller, the latest linux-mtd CVS has support for this.
  See http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/


Serial
------

  The s3c2410 serial driver provides support for the internal
  serial ports. These devices appear as /dev/ttySAC0 through 3.

  To create device nodes for these, use the following commands

    mknod ttySAC0 c 204 64
    mknod ttySAC1 c 204 65
    mknod ttySAC2 c 204 66


GPIO
----

  The core contains support for manipulating the GPIO, see the
  documentation in GPIO.txt in the same directory as this file.


Clock Management
----------------

  The core provides the interface defined in the header file
  include/asm-arm/hardware/clock.h, to allow control over the
  various clock units
