Thin Client / Single Board Computer

The Thin Client, a low cost high power single board computer, has been
designed to provide intuitive graphical displays in embedded systems.

For more details, contact Applied Data Systems or see

Current Linux support for this product has been provided by Nicolas Pitre
<nico@cam.org>.

It's currently possible to mount a root filesystem via NFS providing a
complete Linux environment.  Otherwyse a ramdisk image may be used.  Use
'make thinclient_config' before any 'make config'.  This will set up
defaults for ThinClient support.

Supported peripherals:
- SA1100 LCD frame buffer (only 8bpp yet)
- on-board SMC 92C94 ethernet NIC
- SA1100 serial port
- possibly UCB1200 audio (not tested yet)

To do:
- touchscreen driver
- flash memory access
- 16bpp frame buffer support
- extra (external) serial port driver
- pcmcia
- some console keyboard support (maybe IR?)
- everything else!  :-)

Any contribution can be sent to nico@cam.org and will be greatly welcome!
