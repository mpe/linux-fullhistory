Brutus is an evaluation platform for the SA1100 manufactured by Intel.  
For more details, see:

http://developer.intel.com/design/strong/applnots/sa1100lx/getstart.htm

To compile for Brutus, you must issue the following comands:

	make brutus_config
	make config
	[accept all the defaults]
	make dep
	make zImage

The resulting kernel will end up in linux/arch/arm/boot/zImage.  This file
must be loaded at 0xc0008000 in Brutus's memory and execution started at
0xc0008000 as well.

But prior to execute the kernel, a ramdisk image must also be loaded in
memory.  Use memory address 0x00800000 for this.

Currently supported:
	- RS232 serial ports
	- audio output
	- LCD screen
	- keyboard (needs to be cleaned up badly... any volunteer?)
	
A full PCMCIA support is still missing, although it's possible to hack
some drivers in order to drive already inserted cards at boot time with
little modifications.

Any contribution is welcome.

Please send patches to nico@cam.org

Have Fun !
