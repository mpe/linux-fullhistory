Kernel math emulation
CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION
  Linux can emulate a math coprocessor (used for floating point
  operations) if you don't have one. 486DX and Pentium processors have
  a math coprocessor built in, 486SX and 386 do not, unless you added
  a 487DX or 387, respectively.  (The messages during boot time can
  give you some hints here.) Everyone needs either a coprocessor or
  this emulation. If you enable this emulation even though you have a
  coprocessor, the coprocessor will be used nevertheless. (This
  behavior can be changed with the kernel command line option
  "no387", which comes handy if your coprocessor is broken. See the
  documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to
  pass options to the kernel. The lilo procedure is also explained in
  the SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.) This means that it is a good
  idea to say Y here if you intend to use this kernel on different
  machines. More information about the internals of Linux math
  coprocessor emulation can be found in arch/i386/math-emu/README. If
  you are not sure, say Y; apart from resulting in a 45kB bigger
  kernel, it won't hurt.

Normal floppy disk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD
  If you want to use your floppy disk drive(s) under Linux, say
  Y. Information about this driver, especially important for IBM
  Thinkpad users, is contained in drivers/block/README.fd.  This
  driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be inserted
  in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want). If you
  want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.
  
RAM disk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM
  Enabling this option will allow you to use a portion of your RAM memory 
  as a block device, so that you can make filesystems on it, read and
  write to it and do all the other things that normal block devices can do.
  It is usually used to load and store a copy of a minimal root file
  system off of a floppy into RAM during the initial install of Linux.
  Most normal users won't need this functionality, and can thus say N here.

Normal (MFM/RLL) disk and IDE disk/cdrom support
CONFIG_ST506   		           
  This is the regular, non-SCSI harddisk support. Pretty much everyone
  will want to say Y here, except if they configure a diskless machine
  which mounts all files over the network using NFS (rare; if you are
  planning to do this, have a look at the package
  /pub/Linux/system/Linux-boot/netboot-nfs.tar.gz, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) from sunsite.unc.edu, extract with "tar xzvf
  filename") or if they exclusively use SCSI drives and no IDE/ATAPI
  CDROMs (ATAPI = AT Attachment Packet Interface is a new protocol
  currently used for controlling CDROM and tape drives, similar to the
  SCSI protocol. Some newer CDROM drives such as NEC 260 and MITSUMI
  triple/quad speed drives use it, but most MITSUMI CDROM drives
  don't).  Useful information about how to use large (>504MB) IDE
  harddrives and how to work around a hardware bug in the CMD640 IDE
  interface is contained in drivers/block/README.ide. To fine-tune
  the parameters of your IDE drive for improved performance, you might
  want to have a look at the hdparm package in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/diskdrives/
	
Use old (reliable) disk-only driver for primary i/f
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD
  As you might have guessed, there are now two drivers for IDE
  harddrives around: the old one and the new improved one. The old one
  is not any longer more reliable than the new one. The new driver can
  also handle IDE/ATAPI CDROM drives (ATAPI = AT Attachment Packet
  Interface is a new protocol currently used for controlling CDROM and
  tape drives, similar to the SCSI protocol. Some newer CDROM drives
  such as NEC 260 and MITSUMI triple/quad speed drives use it, but
  most MITSUMI CDROM drives don't). The old driver supports up to two
  hard drives, while the new one can deal with any mix of up to eight
  hard drives and IDE/ATAPI CDROMs, two per IDE interface. Using the
  old driver makes sense if you have older MFM/RLL/ESDI drives, since
  it is smaller and these drives don't benefit from the additional
  features of the new driver. If you have more than one IDE interface
  (=controller), you can use the old driver on the first and the new
  one on the others, if you like.  In that case (or if you have just
  one interface and don't want to use the new driver at all) you would
  say Y here, thereby enlarging your kernel by about 4 kB. If you want
  to use the new driver exclusively, say N and answer Y to the
  following question(s). Useful information about how to use large
  (>504MB) IDE harddrives is contained in drivers/block/README.ide. If
  unsure, say N.

Use new IDE driver for primary/secondary i/f 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE 
  This will use the new and improved IDE driver for the specified IDE
  interface (=controller).  You can use up to 8 IDE harddisks and
  IDE/ATAPI CDROMs, 2 per interface. (ATAPI = AT Attachment Packet
  Interface is a new protocol currently used for controlling CDROM and
  tape drives, similar to the SCSI protocol. Some newer CDROM drives
  such as NEC 260 and MITSUMI triple/quad speed drives use it, but
  most MITSUMI CDROM drives don't.) If you have just one IDE harddisk
  and no IDE/ATAPI CDROM drive and you intend to use the old IDE
  driver on the primary interface, say N here. Everybody else says
  Y. This driver enlarges your kernel by about 8kB. Useful information
  about how to use large (>504MB) IDE harddrives and how to use more
  than 2 IDE interfaces is contained in drivers/block/README.ide.

Include support for IDE/ATAPI CDROMs
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD
  If you have a CDROM drive using the ATAPI protocol, say Y. (ATAPI =
  AT Attachment Packet Interface is a new protocol currently used for
  controlling CDROM and tape drives, similar to the SCSI protocol and
  derived from IDE=ATA. Some newer CDROM drives such as NEC 260 and
  MITSUMI triple/quad speed drives use it, but most MITSUMI CDROM
  drives don't.) If this is your only CDROM drive, you can say N to
  all other CDROM options appearing later, but make sure to say Y to
  the ISO9660 filesystem and read the CDROM-HOWTO, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Note
  that older version of the linux boot loader lilo cannot properly
  deal with IDE/ATAPI CDROMs; install lilo 16 or higher, available
  from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Linux-boot/lilo.

XT harddisk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_XD
  Very old 8 bit hard disk controllers used in the IBM XT
  computer. Pretty unlikely that you have this: say N.

Support for Deskstation Tyne
CONFIG_DESKSTATION_TYNE
#####
##### Anyone have details? It's for the MIPS architecture.
#####

Support for Acer PICA 1 chipset
CONFIG_ACER_PICA_61
#####
##### Anyone have details? It's for the MIPS architecture.
#####

Support for DECstation
CONFIG_DECSTATION
#####
##### Anyone have details? It's for the MIPS architecture.
#####

Generate code for R4x00
CONFIG_R4X00
#####
##### Anyone have details? It's for the MIPS architecture.
#####

Networking support
CONFIG_NET
  Unless you really know what you are doing, you should say Y
  here. The reason is that some programs need it even if you configure
  a stand-alone machine that won't be connected to any other computer.
  If you have recently upgraded from an older kernel, you should
  consider updating your networking tools too; read net/README for
  details. 

Network aliasing
CONFIG_NET_ALIAS
  This is for setting several network addresses on the same low-level network
  device driver. Typically used for services that act different based
  on the address they listen (eg. Apache httpd) or for connecting to
  different logical networks through the same physical interface.
  This is the generic part, later when configuring network protocol
  options you will be asked for protocol-specific aliasing support.
  See net/core/README.alias for more info.
  If you need this features (for any protocol, like IP) say Y.  

Sun floppy controller support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SUNFD
  This is support for floppy drives on Sun Sparc workstations. Say Y
  if you have a floppy drive, otherwise N. Easy.

Alpha system type
CONFIG_ALPHA_AVANTI
  Find out what type of Alpha system you are running. If you can't
  find one of the given names, then try "Noname". For this question,
  it suffices to give a unique prefix of the option you want to
  choose. 

Limit memory to low 16MB
CONFIG_MAX_16M
  This is for some buggy motherboards which cannot properly deal with
  the memory above 16MB. If you have more than 16MB of RAM and
  experience weird problems, you might want to try Y, everyone else
  says N. Note for machines with more that 64MB: in order for the
  kernel to be able to use the memory above 64MB, pass the command
  line option "mem=XXXM" (where XXX is the memory size in
  megabytes) to your kernel. See the documentation of your boot loader
  (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel. The lilo
  procedure is also explained in the SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.
  You also need at least 512kB of RAM cache if you have more than 64MB
  of RAM.

Using SRM as bootloader
CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM
#####
##### Don't know what this is about.
#####

Echo console messages on /dev/ttyS1
CONFIG_SERIAL_ECHO
  If you enable this option, all kernel messages that would usually go
  to the console will also be sent to the device /dev/ttyS1 which
  corresponds to a serial port; this could be useful if you attached
  a terminal or printer to that port.

TGA Console Support
CONFIG_TGA_CONSOLE
#####
##### Has something to do with Alpha.
#####

PCI bios support
CONFIG_PCI
  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
  your box. Other bus systems are ISA, EISA, Microchannel or VESA. If
  you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N. Note: some old PCI motherboards
  have BIOS bugs and may crash if this is enabled (but they run fine
  without this option). The PCI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO, contains
  valuable information about which PCI hardware works under Linux and
  which doesn't.  If some of PCI devices don't work and you get a
  warning during boot time, please follow the instructions at the top of
  include/linux/pci.h. The buggy PCTech RZ 1000 IDE
  harddrive controller which is used in some PCI systems is detected
  and correctly handled by this driver.

PCI bridge optimization (experimental)
CONFIG_PCI_OPTIMIZE
  This can improve access times for some hardware devices under
  certain BIOSes if your computer uses a PCI bussystem. This is
  recommended; say Y.

PCI Triton IDE Bus Master DMA support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_TRITON
  If your PCI system uses an IDE harddrive (as opposed to SCSI, say)
  and includes the Intel PCI Triton chipset (82371FB), you will want
  to enable this option to improve performance. Read the comments at
  the beginning of drivers/block/triton.c. The hdparm utility can be
  gotten via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/diskdrives/. It's safe to
  say Y.

System V IPC
CONFIG_SYSVIPC
  Inter Process Communication is a suite of library functions and system
  calls which let processes (= running programs) synchronize and
  exchange information. It is generally considered to be a good thing,
  and some programs won't run unless you enable this. In particular,
  if you want to run the DOS emulator dosemu under Linux (read the
  DOSEMU-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO), you'll need to say Y here. You
  can find documentation about IPC in ipc.info, which is contained in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/man/info.tar.gz (extract with "tar
  xzvf filename"). These docs are in the info format which is used to
  document GNU software and can be read from within emacs ("Ctrl-h i")
  or with the program info ("man info"). Enabling this option enlarges
  your kernel by about 7kB. Just say Y.

Kernel support for ELF binaries
CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF
  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and
  executables used across different architectures and operating
  systems. This option will enable your kernel to run ELF binaries and
  enlarge it by about 2kB. ELF support under Linux is quickly
  replacing the traditional Linux a.out format because it is portable
  (this does *not* mean that you will be able to run executables from
  different architectures or operating systems!) and makes building
  run-time libraries very easy. Many new executables are distributed
  solely in ELF format. You definitely want to say Y here. Information
  about ELF is on the WWW at http://sable.ox.ac.uk/~jo95004/elf.html
  (To browse the WWW, you need to have access to a machine on the
  Internet that has one of the programs lynx, netscape or Mosaic).  If
  you find that after upgrading to Linux kernel 1.3 and saying Y here,
  you still can't run any ELF binaries (they just crash), then you'll
  have to install the newest ELF runtime libraries, including ld.so
  (available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/packages/GCC). Also note that ELF binary
  support was broken in kernel versions 1.3.0 - 1.3.2. Either use a
  newer 1.3 kernel or one of the stable 1.2 versions. If you want to
  compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and
  removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here and
  read Documentation/modules.txt.

Compile kernel as ELF - if your GCC is ELF-GCC
CONFIG_KERNEL_ELF
  The gcc version 2.7.0 and newer produces the new ELF binary format
  as default. If you have such a compiler (try "gcc -v"), say Y
  here, otherwise N.
  It is possible, albeit almost pointless, to compile the kernel in
  a.out format even if your compiler produces ELF as default. For
  that, you would have to say N here and change the variables LD and
  CC in the toplevel Makefile. Similarly, if your compiler produces
  a.out by default but is able to produce ELF, you can compile the
  kernel in ELF by saying Y here and editing the variables CC
  and LD in the toplevel Makefile.

Use 486-specific optimizations (does NOT work on i386)
CONFIG_M486
  If you have a 486 or better, as opposed to a 386, say Y here:
  things will be slightly faster. However, it is not required: the
  kernel will run on all CPUs without this option. If you are
  not sure, say N; This option will make the kernel use some
  instructions that are only available on 486+ machines.

Use Pentium optimizations
CONFIG_M586 
  If you have a 586 or better, as opposed to a 486, or if you have a
  486 and are very short on memory, say Y here.
  Things will be slightly faster for a 586, and your kernel will be
  smaller.  A kernel with this option enabled will still run on a 486,
  although slightly slower.

Enable loadable module support
CONFIG_MODULES
  Kernel modules are small pieces of compiled code which can be 
  inserted in or removed from the running kernel, using the
  programs insmod and rmmod. This is described in the file 
  Documentation/modules.txt. Modules can be device drivers, file 
  systems, binary executable formats, and so on. If you think that 
  you may want to make use of modules with this kernel in the future, 
  then say Y here.

Set version information on all symbols for modules
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS
  Usually, modules have to be recompiled whenever you
  switch to a new kernel. Enabling this option allows you
  to keep using the same modules even after compiling a new kernel;
  this requires the program modprobe. All the software needed for
  module support is in the modules package in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/kernel, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous). NOTE1: if you say Y here but don't have the program
  genksyms (which is also contained in the above mentioned modules
  package), then the building of your kernel will fail. NOTE2: if you
  say Y here, then you cannot say Y to the PPP driver, below; the only
  option is to compile it as a module (PPP is a protocol for sending
  internet traffic over telephone lines). Therefore, N is a safe bet.

TCP/IP networking
CONFIG_INET
  These are the protocols used on the Internet and on most local
  Ethernets. The safest is to say Y here (which will enlarge your
  kernel by about 35 kB), since some programs (e.g. the X window
  system) use TCP/IP even if your machine is not connected to any
  other computer. You will get the so-called loopback device which
  allows you to ping yourself (great fun, that!). This option is also
  necessary if you want to use the full power of term (term is a
  program which gives you almost full Internet connectivity if you
  have a regular dial up shell account on some Internet connected Unix
  computer. Read the Term-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous)
  on sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO).  Short answer:
  say Y.

IP: forwarding/gatewaying
CONFIG_IP_FORWARD
  People who want to use their Linux box as the router for a local
  network (i.e. the computer responsible for distributing Internet
  traffic to and from the machines in the local network and the
  subnetworks) should say Y here (thereby enlarging their kernel by
  about 5 kB). Note that in this case, you possibly have two ethernet
  devices in your computer: one for the "outside world" and one for
  your local net. The kernel is not able to recognize both at boot
  time without help; for details read the
  Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.  If your box is
  connected to two networks, it may still make sense to say N here,
  namely if you want to turn your box into a firewall protecting a
  local network from the internet. The Firewall-HOWTO tells you how to
  do this. If your setup is more complex, say you are connected to
  three networks and you want to act as a firewall between two of them
  and route traffic for the others, you need to say Y here and enable
  IP firewalling below. If you intend to use IP masquerading (i.e. IP
  traffic from one of the local computers and destined for an outside
  host is changed by your box so that it appears to come from you),
  you'll have to say Y here and also to IP firewalling and IP
  masquerading below. You should say Y here also if you want to
  configure your box as a SLIP (the protocol for sending internet
  traffic over telephone lines) or PPP (a better SLIP) server for
  other people to dial into and your box is connected to a local
  network at the same time. You would then most likely use proxy-ARP
  (Address Resolution Protocol), explained in the Proxy-Arp mini howto
  on sunsite in /pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini. If unsure, say N.

IP: multicasting
CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST
  This is code for addressing several networked computers at once,
  enlarging your kernel by about 2 kB. Some versions of gated, the
  program which constantly updates a networked computer's routing
  tables, require that this option be compiled in. You also need
  multicasting if you intend to participate in the MBONE, a high
  bandwidth network on top of the internet which carries audio and
  video broadcasts. More information about the MBONE is on the WWW at
  http://www.best.com/~prince/techinfo/mbone.html (to browse the WWW,
  you need to have access to a machine on the Internet that has one of
  the programs lynx, netscape or Mosaic). Information about the
  multicast capabilities of the various network cards is contained in
  drivers/net/README.multicast. For most people, it's safe to say N.

IP: firewalling
CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL
  A firewall is a computer which protects a local network from the
  rest of the internet: all traffic to and from computers on the local
  net is inspected by the firewall first. If you want to enlarge your
  kernel by about 2kB and configure your Linux box as a firewall for a
  local network, say Y here. You will need to read the FIREWALL-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Also, you will have to use
  the ipfw tool from the net-tools package, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) from
  ftp.linux.org.uk:/pub/linux/Networking/PROGRAMS/NetTools, or
  preferably ipfwadm from ftp.xos.nl:/pub/linux/ipfwadm/. These
  programs allow selective blocking of internet traffic based on type,
  origin and destination.  You need to enable IP firewalling in order
  to be able to use IP masquerading (i.e. IP traffic from one of the
  local computers and destined for an outside host is changed by your
  box so that it appears to come from you). Chances are that you don't
  want this, so say N.

IP: accounting
CONFIG_IP_ACCT
  This keeps track of your IP network traffic and produces some
  statistics. Usually, you only want to say Y here if your box will be
  a router or a firewall for some local network, in which case you
  naturally should have said Y to IP forwarding/gatewaying resp. IP
  firewalling. The data is accessible with "cat /proc/net/ip_acct", so
  you want to say Y to the /proc filesystem below, if you say Y
  here. To specify what exactly should be recorded, you need the tool
  ipfw from the net-tools package, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) from
  ftp.linux.org.uk:/pub/Linux/Networking/PROGRAMS/NetTools.  Also, you
  might want to have a look at the net-acct package, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Network/management. Most people
  say N, however.

IP: tunneling
CONFIG_NET_IPIP
  Tunneling means to encapsulating data of one protocol type within
  another protocol and sending it over a channel that understands the
  encapsulating protocol. This particular tunneling driver implements
  encapsulation of IP within IP, which sounds kind of pointless, but
  can be useful if you want to make your (or some other) machine
  appear on a different network than it physically is, or to use the 
  mobile IP facilities (which effectively are doing that). Enabling this
  option will produce two modules ( = code which can be inserted in
  and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), one
  encapsulator and one decapsulator.  This is still alpha code, which
  means that it need not be completely stable. You can read details in
  drivers/net/README.tunnel. Most people can say N.
  
IP: firewall packet logging
CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL_VERBOSE
  This gives you information about what your firewall did with
  packets it received. The information is handled by the klogd demon
  which is responsible for kernel messages ("man klogd").

IP: masquerading (ALPHA)
CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE
  If one of the computers on your local network for which your Linux
  box acts as a firewall wants to send something to the outside, your
  box can "masquerade" as that host, i.e. it forwards the traffic to
  the intended destination, but makes it look like it came from the
  firewall host itself. It works both ways: if the outside host
  answers, the firewall will silently forward the traffic to the
  corresponding local computer. This way, the computers on your local
  net are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they
  can reach the outside and can be reached. This makes it possible to
  have the computers on the local network participate on the internet
  even if they don't have officially registered IP addresses.  (This
  last problem can also be solved by connecting the Linux box to the
  Internet using SLiRP [SLiRP is a SLIP/PPP emulator that works if you
  have a regular dial up shell account on some UNIX computer; get if
  via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Network/serial/]).  Details on how
  to set things up are contained in the IP Masquerading FAQ, available
  via ftp (user: anonymous) from ftp.eves.com:/pub/masq/.  This is
  ALPHA code, which means that it need not be completely stable; it
  has nothing to do with the computer architecture of the same
  name. If you want this, say Y.

IP: aliasing support
CONFIG_IP_ALIAS
  You need this to enable IP layer network aliasing. This will also
  enable ARP resolution for alias devices. If you don't need several
  IP addresses per interface, answer N.

IP: multicast routing(in progress)
CONFIG_IP_MROUTE
  This is used if you want your machine to act as a router for IP
  packets that have several destination addresses. Information about
  the multicast capabilities of the various network cards is contained
  in drivers/net/README.multicast. If you haven't heard about it, you
  don't need it.

PC/TCP compatibility mode
CONFIG_INET_PCTCP
  If you have been having difficulties telneting to your Linux machine
  from a DOS system that uses (broken) PC/TCP networking software, try
  enabling this option.  Everyone else says N. As of later 1.3.x kernels
  nobody should need this option. Please report if it solves problems.

Reverse ARP
CONFIG_INET_RARP
  Since you asked: if there are diskless machines on your network that
  know their hardware ethernet address but don't know their IP
  addresses upon startup, they send out a Reverse
  Address Resolution Protocol request to find out their own IP
  addresses. If you want your Linux box to be able to *answer* such
  requests, say Y here; you'd use the program rarp ("man rarp"). If
  you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted
  in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M
  here and read Documentation/modules.txt.  If you don't understand a
  word, say N and rest in peace.

Assume subnets are local
CONFIG_INET_SNARL
  Say Y if you are on a subnetted network with all machines connected
  by Ethernet segments only, as this option optimizes network access
  for this special case. If there are other connections, e.g. SLIP
  links, between machines of your IP network, say N.  If in doubt, say
  N. The PATH mtu discovery facility will cover most cases anyway.

Disable Path MTU Discovery (normally enabled)
CONFIG_NO_PATH_MTU_DISCOVERY
  MTU (maximal transfer unit) is the size of the chunks we send out
  over the net. "Path MTU Discovery" means that, instead of always
  sending very small chunks, we start out sending big ones and if we
  then discover that some host along the way likes its chunks smaller,
  we adjust to a smaller size. This is good, so say N.

Disable NAGLE algorithm (normally enabled)
CONFIG_TCP_NAGLE_OFF
  The NAGLE algorithm works by requiring an acknowledgment before
  sending small IP frames (= packets).  This keeps tiny telnet and
  rlogin packets from congesting Wide Area Networks.  Most people strongly
  recommend to say N here, though, thereby leaving NAGLE enabled. Those
  programs that benefit by disabling the facility should do it on a per
  connection basis themselves anyway.

IP: Drop source routed frames
CONFIG_IP_NOSR
  Usually, the originator of an IP frame (= packet) specifies only the
  destination, and the hosts along the way do the routing, i.e. they
  decide how to forward the frame. However, there is a feature of the
  IP protocol that allows to specify the full route for a given frame
  already at its origin. A frame with such a fully specified route is
  called "source routed". The question now is whether we should honor
  these route requests when such frames arrive, or if we should
  drop all those frames instead. Honoring can introduce security
  problems (and is not required by the IP specification), and hence it
  is recommended to say Y here unless you really know what you're
  doing.

IP: Allow large windows (not recommend if <16Mb of memory)
CONFIG_SKB_LARGE
  This option can speed up network performance. It works by increasing
  the size of socket buffers, thereby reducing overhead but increasing
  memory usage. Say N if you have less than 16Mb of RAM, otherwise Y.
  Note for machines with more that 64MB: in order for the kernel to be
  able to use the memory above 64MB, pass the command line option
  "mem=XXXM" (where XXX is the memory size in megabytes) to your
  kernel. See the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin)
  about how to pass options to the kernel. The lilo procedure is also
  explained in the SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  You also need at least 512kB
  of RAM cache if you have more than 64MB of RAM.

The IPX protocol
CONFIG_IPX
  This is support for the Novell networking protocol, IPX. You need it
  if you want to access Novell Netware servers by using ncpfs or from
  within the Linux DOS emulator dosemu (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO). To turn your Linux box into
  a fully featured Netware file server and IPX router, say Y here and
  fetch lwared from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Networking/daemons/. General
  information about how to connect Linux, Windows machines and Macs is
  on the WWW at http://eats.com/linux_mac_win.html (to browse the WWW,
  you need to have access to a machine on the Internet that has one of
  the programs lynx, netscape or Mosaic). This driver would enlarge
  your kernel by about 5 kB. Unless you have Novell computers on your
  local network, say N.
  BTW: Although it still doesn't work with this release of the kernel you 
  can also find ncpfs (a free Novell client) on linux01.gwdg.de.

Appletalk DDP
CONFIG_ATALK
  Appletalk is the way Apple computers speak to each other on an
  Ethernet (Apple calls it EtherTalk) network. If your linux box is
  connected to such a network and you want to join the conversation,
  say Y. You will need to use the netatalk package so that your Linux
  box can act as a print and file server for macs as well as access
  appletalk printers. Check out
  http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~flowerpt/projects/linux-netatalk/ on
  the WWW for details (to browse the WWW, you need to have access to a
  machine on the Internet that has one of the programs lynx, netscape
  or Mosaic). I hear that the GNU boycott of Apple is over, so even
  politically correct people are allowed to say Y here.

Amateur Radio AX.25 Level 2
CONFIG_AX25
  This is the protocol used for computer communication over amateur
  radio. It is either used by itself for point-to-point links, or to
  carry other protocols such as tcp/ip. To use it, you need a device
  that connects your Linux box to your amateur radio. You can either
  use a low speed TNC (a Terminal Node Controller acts as a kind of
  modem connecting your computer's serial port to your radio's
  microphone input and speaker output) supporting the KISS protocol or
  the much faster Ottawa PI card (to enable support for this card,
  you'll have to answer Y to the question about ALPHA test drivers,
  below) or the Z8530 SCC cards; the latter two require an additional
  radio modem.  In order to use AX.25, you need to get a set of
  supporting software tools via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunacm.swan.ac.uk:/pub/misc/Linux/Radio/. A comprehensive listing of
  all the software for Linux amateur radio users as well as
  information about how to configure an AX.25 port is contained in the
  HAM-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. You might also want to check
  out the file Documentation/networking/ax25.txt in the kernel
  source. More information about digital amateur radio in general is
  on the WWW at
  http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/radio/ham-radio/digital-faq/faq.html
  (To browse the WWW, you need to have access to a machine on the
  Internet that has one of the programs lynx, netscape or
  Mosaic). AX.25 support is actively being developed, so it's best to
  get the very latest 1.3 kernel if you intend to use this.

Amateur Radio NET/ROM
CONFIG_NETROM
  NET/ROM is a network layer protocol on top of AX.25 useful for
  routing.  A comprehensive listing of all the software for Linux
  amateur radio users as well as information about how to configure an
  AX.25 port is contained in the HAM-HOWTO, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. You also might
  also want to check out the file
  Documentation/networking/ax25.txt. More information about digital
  amateur radio in general is on the WWW at
  http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/radio/ham-radio/digital-faq/faq.html
  (To browse the WWW, you need to have access to a machine on the
  Internet that has one of the programs lynx, netscape or
  Mosaic). Amateur radio support is actively being developed, so you
  might want to get the very latest 1.3 kernel if you intend to use
  this.

Kernel/User network link driver(ALPHA)
CONFIG_NETLINK
  This driver allows for two-way communication between certain parts
  of the kernel or modules and user processes; the user processes are
  able to read from and write to character special files in the /dev
  directory having major mode 36. So far, the kernel uses it to
  publish some network related information if you enable "Routing
  messages", below. Say Y if you want to experiment with it; this is
  ALPHA code, which means that it need not be completely stable; it
  has nothing to do with the computer architecture of the same name.

Routing messages
CONFIG_RTNETLINK
  If you enable this and create a character special file /dev/route
  with major number 36 and minor number 0 using mknod ("man mknod"),
  you can read some network related routing information from that
  file. Everything you write to that file will be discarded.

SCSI support?
CONFIG_SCSI
  If you want to use an SCSI harddisk, SCSI tapedrive, SCSI CDROM or
  any other SCSI device under Linux, say Y and make sure that you know
  the name of your SCSI host adaptor (the card inside your computer
  that "speaks" the SCSI protocol), because you will be asked for
  it. And read the SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. This driver is also available
  as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

SCSI disk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD
  If you want to use an SCSI harddisk under Linux, say Y and read the
  SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. This is NOT for SCSI
  CDROMs. This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can
  be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.
  
SCSI tape support
CONFIG_CHR_DEV_ST
  If you want to use an SCSI tapedrive under Linux, say Y and read the
  SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO and drivers/scsi/README.st in
  the kernel source. This is NOT for SCSI CDROMs. This driver is also
  available as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed
  from the running kernel whenever you want). If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

SCSI CDROM support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR
  If you want to use an SCSI CDROM under Linux, say Y and read the
  SCSI-HOWTO and the CDROM-HOWTO from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Also make sure to enable the
  ISO9660 filesystem later. This driver is also available as a module
  ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the running
  kernel whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module,
  say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

SCSI generic support
CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG
  If you want to use SCSI scanners, synthesizers or CD-writers or just
  about anything having "SCSI" in its name, say Y here. Those won't be
  supported by the kernel directly, so you need some additional
  software which knows how to talk to these things using the SCSI
  protocol. Chances are that you'll have to write that software
  yourself, so have a look at the SCSI-HOWTO and at the
  SCSI-Programming-HOWTO, both available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. If you want to compile this
  as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.

Probe all LUNs on each SCSI device
CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN
  If you have an SCSI device that supports more than one LUN (Logical
  Unit Number), e.g. a CD jukebox, you should say Y here so that all
  will be found by the SCSI driver. An SCSI device with multiple LUNs
  acts logically like multiple SCSI devices. The vast majority of SCSI
  devices have only one LUN, and so most people can say N here.

Verbose SCSI error reporting (kernel size +=12K)
CONFIG_SCSI_CONSTANTS
  The error messages regarding your SCSI hardware will be easier to
  understand if you enable this; it will enlarge your kernel by about
  12KB. If in doubt, say Y.

Adaptec AHA152X support
CONFIG_SCSI_AHA152X

  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  If you want to compile this
  as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.

UltraStor 14F/34F support
CONFIG_SCSI_U14_34F
  This is support for the UltraStor 14F, 24F and 34F SCSI-2 host
  adaptor family. The source at drivers/scsi/u14-34f.c contains some
  information about this hardware. If the driver doesn't work out of
  the box, you may have to change some settings in
  drivers/scsi/u14-34f.h. Read the SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) at sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Note
  that there is also another driver for the same hardware: "UltraStor
  SCSI support", below. You should only enable one of them. This
  driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be inserted
  in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want). If you
  want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.

Future Domain 16xx SCSI support

  driver. You want to read the start of drivers/scsi/eata.c and the
  SCSI-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) at
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  If you want to compile this
  as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.

Network device support?
CONFIG_NETDEVICES
  You can say N here in case you don't intend to connect to any other
  computer at all or all your connections will be either via UUCP
  (UUCP is a protocol to forward mail and news between unix hosts over
  telephone lines; read the UUCP-HOWTO, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO) or dialing up a
  shell account or a BBS, even using term (term is a program which
  gives you almost full Internet connectivity if you have a regular
  dial up shell account on some Internet connected Unix computer. Read
  the Term-HOWTO).  You'll have to say Y if your computer contains a
  network card that you want to use under linux (make sure you know
  its name because you will be asked for it and read the
  Ethernet-HOWTO; also, if you plan to use more than one network card
  under linux, read the Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini) or if you want to use
  SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol is the protocol used to send
  Internet traffic over telephone lines or nullmodem cables) or CSLIP
  (compressed SLIP) or PPP (better and newer variant of SLIP) or PLIP
  (Parallel Line Internet Protocol is mainly used to create a mini
  network by connecting the parallel ports of two local machines) or
  AX.25/KISS (protocol for sending internet traffic over radio links).
  Make sure to read the NET-2-HOWTO.  Eventually, you will have to
  read Olaf Kirch's excellent book "Network Administrator's Guide", to
  be found in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP.  If unsure, say Y.

Dummy net driver support
CONFIG_DUMMY
  This is essentially a loopback device (i.e. traffic you send to this
  device is immediately returned back to you) with a configurable IP
  address different from the usual 127.0.0.1. Can be used to give you
  more than one IP address or make your currently inactive SLIP
  address seem like a real address. If you use SLIP or PPP, you might
  want to enable it. Read about it in the Network Administrator's
  Guide, available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP. Since this thing comes often
  handy, the default is Y. It won't enlarge your kernel either. What a
  deal.  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If you want to use
  more than one dummy device at a time, you need to compile it as a
  module. 
  
SLIP (serial line) support
CONFIG_SLIP
  Say Y if you intend to use SLIP or CSLIP (compressed SLIP) to
  connect to your Internet service provider or to connect to some
  other local Unix box or if you want to configure your Linux box as a
  Slip/CSlip server for other people to dial in.  SLIP (Serial Line
  Internet Protocol) is the protocol used to send Internet traffic
  over telephone lines or serial cables (also known as
  nullmodems). Normally, your access provider has to support SLIP in
  order for you to be able to use it, but there is now a SLIP emulator
  called SLiRP around (available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Network/serial/) which allows you
  to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection. If you plan to
  use SLiRP, make sure to say Y to CSLIP, below. The NET-2-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO, explains how to configure
  SLIP. Note that you don't need this option if you just want to run
  term (term is a program which gives you almost full Internet
  connectivity if you have a regular dial up shell account on some
  Internet connected Unix computer. Read the Term-HOWTO). SLIP support
  will enlarge your kernel by about 4kB. If unsure, say N.  If you
  want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted in
  and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here
  and read Documentation/modules.txt as well as
  Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt.
  
CSLIP compressed headers
CONFIG_SLIP_COMPRESSED
  This protocol is faster than SLIP because it uses compression on the
  TCP/IP headers (not on the data itself), but it has to be supported
  on both ends. Ask your access provider if you are not sure and say
  Y, just in case. You will still be able to use plain SLIP. If you
  plan to use SLiRP, the SLIP emulator (available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Network/serial/)
  which allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell
  connection, you definitely want to say Y here. The NET-2-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO, explains how to configure
  CSLIP. This won't enlarge your kernel.

PPP (point-to-point) support
CONFIG_PPP
  PPP (Point to Point Protocol) is a newer and better SLIP. It serves
  the same purpose: sending Internet traffic over telephone (and other
  serial) lines.  Ask your access provider if they support it, because
  otherwise you can't use it (not quite true any more: the free
  program SLiRP can emulate a PPP line if you just have a regular dial
  up shell account on some UNIX computer; get it via ftp (user:
  anonymous) from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Network/serial/).
  To use PPP, you need an additional program called pppd as described
  in Documentation/networking/ppp.txt and in the PPP-HOWTO, available
  from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Note that you don't need
  this option if you just want to run term (term is a program which
  gives you almost full Internet connectivity if you have a regular
  dial up shell account on some Internet connected UNIX computer. Read
  the Term-HOWTO). The PPP option enlarges your kernel by about
  16kB. This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can
  be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). If you said Y to "Version information on all symbols" above,
  then you cannot compile the PPP driver into the kernel; you can only
  compile it as a module. If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read Documentation/modules.txt as well as
  Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt. If unsure, say N.

16 channels instead of 4 
CONFIG_PPP_LOTS
  Saying Y here will allow you to have up to 16 PPP connections
  running in parallel. This is mainly useful if you intend your linux
  box to act as a dial-in PPP server. Most people can say N.

Z8530 SCC kiss emulation driver for AX.2
CONFIG_SCC
  These cards are used to connect your Linux box to an amateur radio
  and communicate with other computers.  If you want to use this, read
  drivers/char/README.scc and the HAM-HOWTO, available available via
  ftp (user: anonymous) at sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.

PLIP (parallel port) support
CONFIG_PLIP
  PLIP (Parallel Line Internet Protocol) is mainly used to create a
  mini network consisting of two local machines. The parallel ports
  are connected using a "null printer" or "Turbo Laplink" cable (you
  can find the wiring in drivers/net/README?.plip).  This works also
  if one of the two machines runs DOS and has some PLIP software
  installed, e.g. NCSA telnet.  If you want to use this, say Y and
  read the NET-2-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  You need to say N or M to
  "parallel printer support" below if you say Y here. Also, you might
  have to edit the file drivers/net/Space.c and adjust the parallel
  port's IRQ (there is a small number of Interrupt ReQuest lines in
  your computer that are used by the periphery to gain the CPU's
  attention - often a source of trouble if two different devices are
  mistakenly configured to use the same IRQ. If you have the /proc
  filesystem installed (see below), you can say "cat /proc/interrupts"
  to see what the different IRQs are currently used for.)  This option
  enlarges your kernel by about 8kB. If unsure, say N.  If you want to
  compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and
  removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here and
  read Documentation/modules.txt as well as
  Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt. If you want to use both a
  parallel printer and PLIP, it is best to compile both drivers as
  modules.

EQL (serial line load balancing) support
CONFIG_EQUALIZER
  If you have two serial connections to some other computer (this
  usually requires two modems and two telephone lines) and you use
  SLIP (= the protocol for sending internet traffic over telephone
  lines) or PPP (= a better SLIP) on them, you can make them behave
  like one double speed connection using this driver. Naturally, this
  has to be supported at the other end as well, either with a similar
  EQL Linux driver or with a Livingston Portmaster 2e. Say Y if you
  want this and read drivers/net/README.eql. This driver is also
  available as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed
  from the running kernel whenever you want). If you want to compile
  it as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

  (all those with an ie0 interface under SunOS).

Do you want to be offered ALPHA test drivers
CONFIG_NET_ALPHA
  ALPHA means that they might be unstable and buggy; it has nothing to
  do with the computer architecture of the same name. If you don't
  have a network card in your computer, say N; otherwise say Y,
  because in most circumstances buggy support for your hardware is
  still better than none at all (in particular, it enables you to test
  and improve the drivers). Note that the answer to this question
  doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just cause this
  configure script to present you with less choices. If you plan to
  use more than one network card under linux, read the
  Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available via ftp (user anonymous)
  from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.

  one network card under linux, read the Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO,
  available from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini. Note that
  the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel:
  saying N will just cause this configure script to skip all the
  questions about Western Digital cards. If you say Y, you will be
  asked for your specific card in the following questions. If you plan
  to use more than one network card under linux, read the

  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous)
  in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Note that the answer to
  this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N will just
  cause this configure script to skip all the questions about 3COM
  cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for your specific card in the
  following questions. If you plan to use more than one network card
  under linux, read the Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available from

  This is a network (ethernet) device which attaches to your parallel
  port. Read drivers/net/atp.c as well as the Ethernet-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO if you want to use this. If
  you plan to use more than one network card under linux, read the
  Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini. If you intend to use
  this driver, you should have said N to the Parallel Printer support,
  because the two drivers don't like each other.

D-Link DE600 pocket adaptor support
CONFIG_DE600
  This is a network (ethernet) device which attaches to your parallel
  port. Read drivers/net/README.DLINK as well as the Ethernet-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO if you want to use this.  If
  you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted
  in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M
  here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If you intend to use this
  pocket adaptor as well as a parallel printer, you should compile
  both drivers as modules. If you plan to use more than one network
  card under linux, read the Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available
  from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.

D-Link DE620 pocket adaptor support
CONFIG_DE620
  This is a network (ethernet) device which attaches to your parallel
  port. Read drivers/net/README.DLINK as well as the Ethernet-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO if you want to use this.  If
  you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted
  in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M
  here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If you intend to use this
  pocket adaptor as well as a parallel printer, you should compile
  both drivers as modules. If you plan to use more than one network
  card under linux, read the Multiple-Ethernet-mini-HOWTO, available
  from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini.
 
Token Ring driver support
CONFIG_TR
  Token Ring is IBM's way of communication on a local network; the
  rest of the world uses ethernet. If you are connected to a token
  ring network and want to use your Token Ring card under Linux, say Y.
  Most people can say N here.

IBM Tropic chipset based adaptor support
CONFIG_IBMTR
  This is support for all IBM Token Ring cards that don't use DMA. If
  you have such a beast, say Y, otherwise N. Warning: this driver will
  almost definitely fail if more than one active Token Ring card is
  present. This driver is also available as a module ( = code which
  can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.

Support non-SCSI/IDE/ATAPI drives
CONFIG_CD_NO_IDESCSI
  If you have a CDROM drive that is neither SCSI nor IDE/ATAPI, say Y
  here, otherwise N. Read the CDROM-HOWTO, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Note that the
  answer to this question doesn't directly affect the kernel: saying N
  will just cause this configure script to skip all the questions
  about these CDROM drives. If you are unsure what you have, say Y and
  find out whether you have one of the following drives.
  For each of these drivers, a file Documentation/cdrom/<driver_name>
  exists. Especially in cases where you do not know exactly which kind
  of drive you have you should read there.
  Most of these drivers use a file include/linux/<driver_name>.h where
  you can define your interface parameters and switch some internal
  goodies.
  All these CDROM drivers are also usable as a module (= code which can
  be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile them as module, say M instead of Y and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.
  If you want to use any of these CDROM drivers, you also have to say
  Y to "ISO9660 cdrom filesystem support" below (this answer will get
  "defaulted" for you if you enable any of the Linux CDROM drivers).

Sony CDU31A/CDU33A CDROM support
CONFIG_CDU31A
  These CDROM drives have a spring-pop-out caddyless drawer, and a
  rectangular green LED centered beneath it.
  NOTE: these CDROM drives will not be auto detected by the kernel at
  boot time; you have to provide the interface address as an option to
  the kernel as described in Documentation/cdrom/cdu31a or fill in your
  parameters into linux/drivers/cdrom/cdu31a.c. See the documentation
  of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to 
  the kernel. The lilo procedure is also explained in the SCSI-HOWTO.

Standard Mitsumi [no XA/Multisession] CDROM support
CONFIG_MCD
  This is the older of the two drivers for the older Mitsumi models
  LU-005, FX-001 and FX-001D. This is not the right driver for the 
  FX-001DE and the triple or quad speed models (all these are IDE/ATAPI
  models).
  With the old LU-005 model, the whole drive chassis slides out for
  cd insertion.  The FX-xxx models use a motorized tray type mechanism.
  Note that this driver does not support XA or MultiSession CDs (PhotoCDs).
  There is a new driver (next question) which can do this. If you want
  that one, say N here.
  If the driver doesn't work out of the box, you might want to have
  a look at linux/include/linux/mcd.h.

Mitsumi [XA/MultiSession] support
CONFIG_MCDX
  Use this driver if you want to be able to read XA or MultiSession
  CDs (PhotoCDs) as well as ordinary CDs with your Mitsumi LU-005,
  FX-001 or FX-001D CDROM drive. In addition, this driver uses much less
  kernel memory than the old one, if that is a concern. This driver is
  able to support more than one drive, but each drive needs a separate
  interface card.

Matsushita/Panasonic/Creative, Longshine, TEAC CDROM support
CONFIG_SBPCD
  This driver supports most of the drives which use the Panasonic or
  SoundBlaster interface.
  The Matsushita CR-521, CR-522, CR-523, CR-562, CR-563 drives (sometimes
  labelled "Creative"), the CreativeLabs CD200, the Longshine LCS-7260,
  the "IBM External ISA CDROM" (in fact a CR-56x model), the TEAC CD-55A
  fall under this category. Some other "electrically compatible" drives
  (Vertos, Genoa, some Funai models) are currently not supported; for the
  Sanyo H94A drive currently a separate driver (asked later) is responsible.
  Most drives have a uniquely shaped faceplate, with a caddyless motorized
  drawer, but without external brand markings. The older CR-52x drives have
  a caddy and manual loading/eject, but still no external markings.
  The driver is able to do an extended auto-probing for interface addresses
  and drive types; this can help to find facts in cases you are not sure,
  but can consume some time during the boot process if none of the supported
  drives gets found.
  Once your drive got found, you should enter the reported parameters into
  linux/include/linux/sbpcd.h and set "DISTRIBUTION 0" there.
  This driver can support up to four CDROM interface cards, and each card
  can support up to four CDROM drives; if you say Y here, you will be asked
  how many controllers you have. If compiled as a module, only one interface
  card (but with up to four drives) is usable.

Matsushita/Panasonic, ... second CDROM controller support
CONFIG_SBPCD2
  Say Y here only if you have two CDROM controller boards of this type
  (usually only if you have more than four drives). You should enter
  the parameters for the second, third and fourth interface card into
  linux/include/linux/sbpcd.h before compiling the new kernel.

Aztech/Orchid/Okano/Wearnes/TXC (non IDE) CDROM support
CONFIG_AZTCD
  This is your driver if you have an Aztech CDA268-01A, Orchid CD-3110,
  Okano or Wearnes CDD110 or a Conrad TXC CDROM drive.
  This driver - just like all these CDROM drivers - is NOT for CDROM
  drives with IDE/ATAPI interface, such as Aztech CDA269-031SE.

Sony CDU535 CDROM support
CONFIG_CDU535
  This is the driver for the older Sony CDU-535 and CDU-531 CDROM drives.

Goldstar R420 CDROM support
CONFIG_GSCD
  If this is your CDROM drive, say Y here.
  As described in linux/Documentation/cdrom/gscd, you might have to
  change a setting in the file include/linux/gscd.h before compiling
  the kernel.

Philips/LMS CM206 CDROM support
CONFIG_CM206
  If you have a Philips/LMS CDROM drive cm206 in combination with a
  cm260 host adapter card, say Y here.

Optics Storage DOLPHIN 8000AT CDROM support
CONFIG_OPTCD
  If this is your CDROM drive, say Y here.

Sanyo H94A CDROM support
CONFIG_SJCD
  If this is your CDROM drive, say Y here.

Standard (minix) fs support
CONFIG_MINIX_FS
  Minix is a simple operating system used in many classes about
  OS's. The minix filesystem (= method to organize files on a harddisk
  partition or a floppy disk) was the original filesystem for Linux,
  has been superseded by the second extended filesystem ext2fs but is
  still used for root/boot and other floppies or ram disks since it is
  leaner. You don't want to use it on your harddisk because of certain
  built-in restrictions. This option will enlarge your kernel by about
  25 kB. Everyone should say Y or M so that they are able to read this
  common floppy format.  If you want to compile this as a module
  however ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. Note that the filesystem of your root
  partition cannot be compiled as a module.

Extended fs support
CONFIG_EXT_FS
  This is the old Linux filesystem (= method to organize files on a
  harddisk partition or a floppy disk) and not in use anymore. It
  enlarges your kernel by about 25 kB. Let's all kill this beast. Say
  N.

Second extended fs support
CONFIG_EXT2_FS
  This is the de facto standard Linux filesystem (= method to organize
  files on a storage device) for harddisks. You want to say Y, unless
  you intend to use Linux exclusively from inside a DOS partition
  using the umsdos filesystem. The advantage of the latter is that you
  can get away without repartitioning your hard drive (which often
  implies backing everything up and restoring afterwards); the
  disadvantage is that Linux becomes susceptible to DOS viruses and
  that umsdos is somewhat slower than ext2fs. Even if you want to run
  Linux in this fashion, it might be a good idea to have ext2fs
  around: it enables you to read more floppy disks and facilitates the
  transition to a *real* Linux partition later. Another (rare) case
  which doesn't require ext2fs is a diskless Linux box which mounts
  all files over the network using NFS (in this case it's sufficient
  to enable NFS filesystem support below; if you are planning to do
  this, have a look at the package
  /pub/Linux/system/Linux-boot/netboot-nfs.tar.gz, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) from sunsite.unc.edu, extract with "tar xzvf
  filename"). There is a short ext2fs-FAQ, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/faqs. This
  option will enlarge your kernel by about 41 kB. Default is Y.

xiafs filesystem support
CONFIG_XIA_FS
  This is an old filesystem (= method to organize files on a harddisk
  partition or a floppy disk) and not in use anymore. This option
  would enlarge your kernel by about 28 kB. Let's all kill this beast:
  say N.  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can
  be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want), say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. Note that the
  filesystem of your root partition cannot be compiled as a module.

msdos fs support
CONFIG_MSDOS_FS
  This allows you to mount MSDOS partitions of your harddrive (unless
  they are compressed; the only way to access compressed MSDOS
  partitions under Linux is with the DOS emulator DOSEMU, described in
  the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) at
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. If you intend to use dosemu
  with a non-compressed MSDOS partition, say Y here) and MSDOS
  floppies. This means that file access becomes transparent, i.e. the
  MSDOS files look and behave just like all other Unix files.  Another
  way to read and write MSDOS floppies from within Linux (but not
  transparently) is with the mtools ("man mtools") program suite,
  which doesn't require the msdos filesystem support.  If you want to
  use umsdos, the Unix-like filesystem on top of DOS, which allows you
  to run Linux from within a DOS partition without repartitioning,
  you'll have to say Y here. This option will enlarge your kernel by
  about 25 kB. If unsure, say Y.  If you want to compile this as a
  module however ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from
  the running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. Note that the filesystem of your root
  partition cannot be a module.

umsdos: Unix like fs on top of std MSDOS FAT fs
CONFIG_UMSDOS_FS
  Say Y here if you want to run Linux from within an existing DOS
  partition of your harddrive. The advantage of this is that you can
  get away without repartitioning your hard drive (which often implies
  backing everything up and restoring afterwards) and hence you're
  able to quickly try out Linux or show it to your friends; the
  disadvantage is that Linux becomes susceptible to DOS viruses and
  that UMSDOS is somewhat slower than ext2fs.  Another use of umsdos
  is to write files with long unix filenames to MSDOS floppies; it
  also allows unix style softlinks and owner/permissions of files on
  MSDOS floppies. You will need a program called umssync in order to
  make use of umsdos. Read Documentation/filesystems/umsdos.txt. This
  option enlarges your kernel by about 25 kB. If unsure, say N.  If
  you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted
  in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M
  here and read Documentation/modules.txt. Note that the filesystem of
  your root partition cannot be a module.

/proc filesystem support
CONFIG_PROC_FS
  This is a virtual filesystem providing information about the status
  of the system. "Virtual" means that it doesn't take any space on
  your harddisk: the files are created on the fly when you access
  them. Also, you cannot read the files with less or more: you need to
  use cat. The filesystem is explained in the Kernel Hacker's Guide,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP and also on the proc(8) manpage
  ("man 8 proc").  This option will enlarge your kernel by about 18
  kB. It's totally cool; for example, "cat /proc/interrupts" gives
  information about what the different IRQs are used for at the moment
  (there is a small number of Interrupt ReQuest lines in your computer
  that are used by the periphery to gain the CPU's attention - often a
  source of trouble if two devices are mistakenly configured to use
  the same IRQ). Several programs depend on this, so everyone should
  say Y here.
  
NFS filesystem support
CONFIG_NFS_FS
  If you are connected to some other (usually local) Unix computer
  (using SLIP, PLIP, PPP or ethernet) and want to mount files
  residing on that computer (the NFS server) using the Network
  File Sharing protocol, say Y. "Mounting files" means that the client
  can access the files with usual UNIX commands as if they were
  sitting on the client's harddisk. For this to work, the server must
  run the programs nfsd and mountd (but does not need to have NFS
  filesystem support enabled). NFS is explained in the Network
  Administrator's Guide, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP, and on its man page: "man
  nfs". There is also a NFS-FAQ in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/faqs which presumes that you know
  the basics of NFS already. If you say Y here, you should have said Y
  to TCP/IP networking also. This option would enlarge your kernel by
  about 27 kB. This filesystem is also available as a module ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read Documentation/modules.txt. If you don't know what all
  this is about, say N.

Root file system on NFS
CONFIG_ROOT_NFS
  If you want your Linux box to mount its whole root filesystem from
  some other computer over the net via NFS (presumably because your
  box doesn't have a harddisk), say Y here. You will then have to
  specify the directory that should be remotely mounted with the
  "root" kernel command line option. See the documentation of your
  boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
  kernel. The lilo procedure is also explained in the SCSI-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.) Most people say N here.

ISO9660 cdrom filesystem support
CONFIG_ISO9660_FS
  If you have a CDROM and want to do more with it than just listen to
  audio CDs and watch its LEDs, say Y (and read the CDROM-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO), thereby enlarging your
  kernel by about 27 kB; otherwise say N.  If you want to compile this
  as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.

OS/2 HPFS filesystem support (read only)
CONFIG_HPFS_FS
  OS/2 is IBM's operating system for PC's, the same as Warp, and HPFS
  is the filesystem used for organizing files on OS/2 harddisk
  partitions. Say Y if you want to be able to read files from an OS/2
  HPFS partition of your harddrive. OS/2 floppies however are in
  regular MSDOS format, so you don't need this option in order to be
  able to read them. Read Documentation/filesystems/hpfs.txt. This
  filesystem is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. If unsure, say N.
  
System V and Coherent filesystem support
CONFIG_SYSV_FS
  SCO, Xenix and Coherent are commercial Unix systems for intel
  machines. Enabling this option would allow you to read and write to
  and from their floppies and harddisk partitions. If you have a
  floppy or harddisk partition like that, it is probable that they
  contain binaries from those other Unix systems; in order to run
  these binaries, you will want to install iBCS2 (iBCS2 [Intel Binary
  Compatibility Standard] is a kernel module which lets you run SCO,
  Xenix, Wyse, Unix Ware, Dell Unix and System V programs under Linux
  and is often needed to run commercial software, most prominently
  WordPerfect. It's in tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/BETA). If you only
  intend to mount files from some other Unix over the network using
  NFS, you don't need this (but you need nfs filesystem support
  obviously). Note that this option is generally not needed for
  floppies, since a good portable way to transport files between
  unixes (and even to other operating systems) is given by the tar
  program ("man tar").  Note also that this option has nothing to do
  whatsoever with the option "System V IPC". Read about the System V
  filesystem in Documentation/filesystems/sysv-fs.txt. This option
  will enlarge your kernel by about 34 kB. If you want to compile this
  as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. If you haven't heard about all of this
  before, it's safe to say N.

SMB filesystem support (to mount WfW shares etc..)
CONFIG_SMB_FS
  SMB (Server Message Buffer) is the protocol Windows for Workgroups
  (WfW), Windows NT and Lan Manager use to talk to each other over an
  ethernet. Enabling this allows you to mount their filesystems and
  access them just like any other unix directory. For details, read
  Documentation/filesystems/smbfs.txt.  Note: if you just want your
  box to act as an SMB *server* and make files and printing services
  available to Windows clients (which need to have a TCP/IP stack),
  you don't need to enable this filesystem support; you can use the
  program samba (available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Network/samba) for that. General
  information about how to connect Linux, Windows machines and Macs is
  on the WWW at http://eats.com/linux_mac_win.html (to browse the WWW,
  you need to have access to a machine on the Internet that has one of
  the programs lynx, netscape or Mosaic).  If you want to compile this
  as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. Most people say N, however.

NCP filesystem support (to mount NetWare volumes)
CONFIG_NCP_FS
  NCP (NetWare Core Protocol) is a protocol that runs over IPX and is
  used by NetWare clients to talk to file servers. Enabling this
  allows you to mount NetWare file server volumes and access them just
  like any other directory. To actually mount the filesystem, you need
  a special mount program, available on sunsite.unc.edu via anonymous
  ftp in /pub/Linux/system/Filesystem/ncpfs-xx.tgz. If you want to
  compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and
  removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here and
  read Documentation/modules.txt.

Cyclades async mux support
CONFIG_CYCLADES
  This is a card which gives you many serial ports. You would need
  something like this to connect more than two modems to your linux
  box, for instance in order to become a BBS. If you want to compile
  this as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from
  the running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. If you haven't heard about it, it's safe
  to say N.

Stallion multiport serial support 
CONFIG_STALDRV
  Stallion cards give you many serial ports. You would need something
  like this to connect more than two modems to your linux box, for
  instance in order to become a BBS. If you say Y here, you will be
  asked for your specific card model in the next questions. If you
  haven't heard about it, it's safe to say N.
 
Stallion EasyIO or EC8/32 support 
CONFIG_STALLION n
  If you have an EasyIO or EasyConnection 8/32 multiport Stallion
  card, then this is for you; say Y.  If you want to compile this as a
  module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.

CONFIG_ISTALLION n
  If you have an EasyConnection 8/64, ONboard, Brumby or Stallion
  serial multiport card, say Y here. To compile it as a module ( =
  code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want), say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

Parallel printer support
CONFIG_PRINTER
  If you intend to attach a printer to the parallel port of your Linux
  box (as opposed to using a serial printer; if the connector at the
  printer has 9 or 25 holes ["female"], then it's serial), say Y. Also
  read the Printing-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  If you want to compile this
  as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. If you intend to use PLIP (Parallel Line
  Internet Protocol is mainly used to create a mini network by
  connecting the parallel ports of two local machines) or a ethernet
  network pocket adaptor attaching to the parallel port and a parallel
  printer as well, you should compile both drivers as modules because
  the drivers both want the same resources.

Logitech busmouse support
CONFIG_BUSMOUSE
  Logitech mouse connected to a proprietary interface card. It's
  generally a round connector with 9 pins. Note that the newer mice
  made by Logitech don't use the Logitech protocol anymore; for those,
  you don't need this option. You want to read the Busmouse-HOWTO,
  available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  If you want to compile this
  as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. If you are unsure, say N and read the
  HOWTO nevertheless: it will tell you what you have. Chances are that
  you have a regular serial MouseSystem or Microsoft mouse (made by
  Logitech) plugging in a COM port (rectangular with 9 or 25 pins)
  which is supported automatically.

PS/2 mouse (aka "auxiliary device") support
CONFIG_PSMOUSE
  The PS/2 mouse connects to a special mouse port that looks much like
  the keyboard port (small circular connector with 6 pins). This way,
  the mouse does not use any serial ports. This port can also be used
  for other input devices like light pens, tablets, keypads. Compaq,
  AST and IBM all use this as their mouse port on currently shipping
  machines. The trackballs of some laptops are PS/2 mice
  also. Although this is not a busmouse, it is explained in detail in
  the Busmouse-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  If you want to compile this
  as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt. If you are unsure, say N and read the
  HOWTO nevertheless: it will tell you what you have. Chances are that
  you have a regular serial MouseSystem or Microsoft mouse plugging in
  a COM port (9 or 25 pins) which is supported automatically.

C&T 82C710 mouse port support (as on TI Travelmate)
CONFIG_82C710_MOUSE
  This is a certain kind of PS/2 mouse used on the TI Travelmate. If
  you are unsure, try first to say N here and come back if the mouse
  doesn't work. Read the Busmouse-HOWTO, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.

Microsoft busmouse support
CONFIG_MS_BUSMOUSE
  These animals (also called Inport mice) are connected to an
  expansion board using a round connector with 9 pins. If this is what
  you have, say Y and read the Busmouse-HOWTO, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  If you
  want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted in
  and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here
  and read Documentation/modules.txt. If you are unsure, say N and
  read the HOWTO nevertheless: it will tell you what you have. Chances
  are that you have a regular serial MouseSystem or Microsoft mouse
  plugging in a COM port which is supported automatically. Also be aware
  several vendors talk about 'Microsoft busmouse' and actually mean PS/2
  busmouse - so count the pins on the connector.

ATIXL busmouse support
CONFIG_ATIXL_BUSMOUSE
  This is a rare type of busmouse that is connected to the back of an
  ATI video card. Note that most ATI mice are actually Microsoft
  busmice. Read the Busmouse-HOWTO, available via ftp (user:
  anonymous) in sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.  If you want to
  compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and
  removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here and
  read Documentation/modules.txt. If you are unsure, say N and read
  the HOWTO nevertheless: it will tell you what you have. Chances are
  that you have a regular serial MouseSystem or Microsoft mouse
  plugging in a COM port (9 or 25 pins) which is supported
  automatically.

Selection (cut and paste for virtual consoles)
CONFIG_SELECTION
  This allows you to use your mouse for moving text on a Linux console
  or even between several virtual consoles. Read about it with "man
  selection". You also need it to run gpm ("general purpose mouse")
  which is a superset of selection. This is explained in the
  Busmouse-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous) in
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO, although selection works fine
  with serial mice, too. Most people say Y unless they run mainly the
  X Window System, which has its own cut-and-paste mechanism. Enabling
  this option enlarges your kernel by about 1 kB. Newer kernels
  contain this code by default and don't have this config option
  anymore. 

QIC-02 tape support
CONFIG_QIC02_TAPE
  If you have a non-SCSI tape drive like that, say Y.

Do you want runtime configuration for QIC-02
CONFIG_QIC02_DYNCONF
  You can either configure this driver once and for all by editing a
  header file, in which case you should say N, or you can fetch a
  program via anonymous ftp which is able to configure this driver
  during runtime. If you want this, say Y.

QIC-117 tape support
CONFIG_FTAPE
  Most tape drives using the floppy disk controller will need
  this. Colorado Jumbo, Conner Tape-Stor would be two models of this.
  If you have a non-SCSI tape device like that, say Y. QIC-40 users
  say Y too. And everyone read the Ftape-HOWTO, available via ftp
  (user: anonymous) from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. Tape
  drives that attach to the parallel port, like the Colorado Tracker,
  are not yet supported by Linux.  Note that saying Y here will not
  insert the code into the kernel: instead, a module will be compiled
  ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the running
  kernel whenever you want). Read Documentation/modules.txt to find
  out how to use it.

number of ftape buffers
NR_FTAPE_BUFFERS 3
  The floppy tape drive needs some memory allocated in the kernel.
  n buffers, each having 32 kB, will be allocated if you enter n
  here. Consequently, your kernel size increases by n*32 kB. You
  should accept the default unless you know what you're doing.

Zilog serial support
CONFIG_SUN_ZS
  This driver does not exist at this point, so you might as well say
  N.

Advanced Power Management
CONFIG_APM
  This driver provides APM support on machines with an APM-compliant 32-bit
  BIOS.  Specifically, the time will be reset after a USER RESUME
  operation, the /proc/apm device will provide battery status information,
  and ioctls are provided to put the machine in STANDBY or SUSPEND mode.
  This is most useful on laptops with a compliant BIOS.

Ignore USER SUSPEND
CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND
  This option will ignore USER SUSPEND requests.  On machines with a
  compliant APM BIOS, this is never what you want to do.  However, this is
  necessary on the NEC Versa M series, which generates these when resuming
  from SYSTEM SUSPEND.  Enabling this on other laptops may cause the laptop
  to generate a CRITICAL SUSPEND when an appropriate USER SUSPEND is
  ignored -- this may prevent the APM driver from updating the system time
  on a RESUME.

Enable APM features
CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE
  Enable APM features at boot time.  From page 36 of the APM BIOS
  specification: "When disabled, the APM BIOS does not automatically power
  manage devices, enter the Standby State, enter the Suspend State, or take
  power saving steps in response to CPU Idle calls."  This driver will make
  CPU Idle calls when Linux is idle (unless this feature is turned off --
  see below).  This should always save battery power, but more complicated
  APM features will be dependent on your BIOS implementation.  You may need
  to turn this option off if your computer hangs at boot time when using
  APM support, or if it beeps continuously instead of suspending.  Turn
  this off if you have a NEC UltraLite Versa 33/C or a Toshiba T400CDT.
  This is off by default since most machines do fine without this feature.

Do CPU IDLE calls
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE
  Enable calls to APM CPU Idle/CPU Busy inside the kernel's idle loop.  On
  some machines, this can activate improved power savings, such as a slowed
  CPU clock rate, when the machine is idle.  These idle call is made after
  the idle loop has run for some length of time (e.g., 333 mS).  On some
  machines, this will cause a hang at boot time or whenever the CPU becomes
  idle.  (On machines with more than one CPU, this option does nothing.)

Black display
CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK
  Enable console blanking using the APM.  Some laptops can use this to turn
  off the LCD backlight when the VC screen blanker blanks the screen.  Note
  that this is only used by the VC screen blanker, and won't turn off the
  backlight when using X11.

Sound card support
CONFIG_SOUND
  If you have a Sound Card in your Computer, i.e. if it can say more
  than an occasional beep, say Y. Be sure to have all the information
  about your sound card and its configuration down (I/O port,
  interrupt and DMA channel), because you will be asked for it. You
  want to read the Sound-HOWTO, available via ftp (user: anonymous)
  from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. There is also some
  information in various README files in drivers/sound.  If you want
  to compile this as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and
  removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here and
  read Documentation/modules.txt. I'm told that even without a sound
  card, you can make your computer say more than an occasional beep,
  by programming the PC speaker. Kernel patches and programs to do
  that are at
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/console/pcsndrv-X.X.tar.gz,
  to be extracted with "tar xzvf filename".

Sun Audio support
CONFIG_SUN_AUDIO
  This is support for the soundcards on Sun workstations. The code
  does not exist yet, so you might as well say N here.

Kernel profiling support
CONFIG_PROFILE
  This is for kernel hackers who want to know how much time the kernel
  spends in the various procedures. The information is stored in
  /proc/profile (enable the /proc filesystem!) and in order to read
  it, you need the readprofile package from sunsite.unc.edu. Its
  manpage gives information regarding the format of profiling data. To
  become a kernel hacker, you can start with the Kernel Hacker's
  Guide, available via ftp (user: anonymous) from
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP. Mere mortals say N.
 
Profile shift count
CONFIG_PROFILE_SHIFT
  This is used to adjust the granularity with which the addresses of
  executed instructions get recorded in /proc/profile. But since you
  enabled "Kernel profiling support", you must be a kernel hacker and
  hence you know what this is about :-)
