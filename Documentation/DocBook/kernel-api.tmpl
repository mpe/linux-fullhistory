       When writing drivers, you cannot in general use routines which are
       from the C Library.  Some of the functions have been found generally

       may vary slightly from those defined by ANSI, and these deviations

    <title>USB Devices</title>

    <para>Drivers for USB devices talk to the "usbcore" APIs, and are
    exposed through driver frameworks such as block, character,
    or network devices.
    There are two types of public "usbcore" APIs:  those intended for
    general driver use, and those which are only public to drivers that
    are part of the core.
    The drivers that are part of the core are involved in managing a USB bus.
    They include the "hub" driver, which manages trees of USB devices, and
    several different kinds of "host controller" driver (HCD), which control
    individual busses.
    </para>

    <para>The device model seen by USB drivers is relatively complex.
    </para>
     
    <itemizedlist>

	<listitem><para>USB supports four kinds of data transfer
	(control, bulk, interrupt, and isochronous).  Two transfer
	types use bandwidth as it's available (control and bulk),
	while the other two types of transfer (interrupt and isochronous)
	are scheduled to provide guaranteed bandwidth.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>The device description model includes one or more
	"configurations" per device, only one of which is active at a time.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Configurations have one or more "interface", each
	of which may have "alternate settings".  Interfaces may be
	standardized by USB "Class" specifications, or may be specific to
	a vendor or device.</para>

	<para>USB device drivers actually bind to interfaces, not devices.
	Think of them as "interface drivers", though you
	may not see many devices where the distinction is important.
	Most USB devices are simple, with only one configuration,
	one interface, and one alternate setting.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Interfaces have one or more "endpoints", each of
	which supports one type and direction of data transfer such as
	"bulk out" or "interrupt in".  The entire configuration may have
	up to sixteen endpoints in each direction, allocated as needed
	among all the interfaces.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Data transfer on USB is packetized; each endpoint
	has a maximum packet size.
	Drivers must often be aware of conventions such as flagging the end
	of bulk transfers using "short" (including zero length) packets.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>The Linux USB API supports synchronous calls for
	control and bulk messaging.
	It also supports asynchnous calls for all kinds of data transfer,
	using request structures called "URBs" (USB Request Blocks).
	</para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Accordingly, the USB Core API exposed to device drivers
    covers quite a lot of territory.  You'll probably need to consult
    the USB 2.0 specification, available online from www.usb.org at
    no cost, as well as class or device specifications.

  <chapter id="fbdev">
     <title>Frame Buffer Library</title>

     <para>
       The frame buffer drivers depend heavily on four data structures.  
       These structures are declared in include/linux/fb.h.  They are 
       fb_info, fb_var_screeninfo, fb_fix_screeninfo and fb_monospecs. 
       The last three can be made available to and from userland. 
     </para>

     <para>
       fb_info defines the current state of a particular video card. 
       Inside fb_info, there exists a fb_ops structure which is a 
       collection of needed functions to make fbdev and fbcon work.
       fb_info is only visible to the kernel.
     </para>

     <para>
       fb_var_screeninfo is used to describe the features of a video card 
       that are user defined.  With fb_var_screeninfo, things such as
       depth and the resolution may be defined.
     </para>

     <para>
       The next structure is fb_fix_screeninfo. This defines the 
       properties of a card that are created when a mode is set and can't 
       be changed otherwise.  A good example of this is the start of the 
       frame buffer memory.  This "locks" the address of the frame buffer
       memory, so that it cannot be changed or moved.
     </para>

     <para>
       The last structure is fb_monospecs. In the old API, there was 
       little importance for fb_monospecs. This allowed for forbidden things 
       such as setting a mode of 800x600 on a fix frequency monitor. With 
       the new API, fb_monospecs prevents such things, and if used 
       correctly, can prevent a monitor from being cooked.  fb_monospecs
       will not be useful until kernels 2.5.x.
