		       LINUX ALLOCATED DEVICES
	     Maintained by H. Peter Anvin <hpa@zytor.com>

		    Last revised: August 10, 1998

This list is the Linux Device List, the official registry of allocated
device numbers and /dev directory nodes for the Linux operating
system.

The latest version of this list is included with the Linux kernel
sources in LaTeX and ASCII form.  It is also available separately from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/device-list/.  In case of
discrepancy between the text and LaTeX versions, the LaTeX version is
authoritative.

This document is included by reference into the Linux Filesystem
Standard (FSSTND).  The FSSTND is available from
ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/docs/linux-standards/fsstnd/.

Allocations marked (68k/Amiga) apply to Linux/68k on the Amiga
platform only.	Allocations marked (68k/Atari) apply to Linux/68k on
the Atari platform only.

This document is in the public domain.	The author requests, however,
that semantically altered versions are not distributed without
permission of the author, assuming the author can be contacted without
an unreasonable effort.

In particular, please don't sent patches for this list to Linus, at
least not without contacting me first.

I do not have any information about these devices beyond what appears
on this list.  Any such information requests will be deleted without
reply.

     **** PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE SUBMITTING A DEVICE ENTRY ****

To have a major number allocated, or a minor number in situations
where that applies (e.g. busmice), please contact me with the
appropriate device information.	 Also, if you have additional
information regarding any of the devices listed below, or if I have
made a mistake, I would greatly appreciate a note.

I do, however, make two requests about the nature of your report.
This is necessary for me to be able to keep this list up to date and
correct in a timely manner.  First of all, *please* include the word
"device" in the subject so your mail won't accidentally get buried!  I
receive hundreds of email messages a day, so mail sent with other
subjects may very well get lost in the avalanche.

Second, please include a description of the device *in the same format
as this list*.	The reason for this is that it is the only way I have
found to ensure I have all the requisite information to publish your
device and avoid conflicts.

Your cooperation is appreciated.


  0		Unnamed devices (e.g. non-device mounts)
		  0 = reserved as null device number

  1 char	Memory devices
		  1 = /dev/mem		Physical memory access
		  2 = /dev/kmem		Kernel virtual memory access
		  3 = /dev/null		Null device
		  4 = /dev/port		I/O port access
		  5 = /dev/zero		Null byte source
		  6 = /dev/core		OBSOLETE - replaced by /proc/kcore
		  7 = /dev/full		Returns ENOSPC on write
		  8 = /dev/random	Nondeterministic random number gen.
		  9 = /dev/urandom	Faster, less secure random number gen.
    block	RAM disk
		  0 = /dev/ram0		First RAM disk
		    ...
		  7 = /dev/ram7		Eighth RAM disk
		250 = /dev/initrd	Initial RAM disk

		Older kernels had /dev/ramdisk (1, 1) here.
		/dev/initrd refers to a RAM disk which was preloaded
		by the boot loader.
		    
  2 char	Pseudo-TTY masters
		  0 = /dev/ptyp0	First PTY master
		  1 = /dev/ptyp1	Second PTY master
		    ...
		255 = /dev/ptyef	256th PTY master

		Pseudo-tty's are named as follows:
		* Masters are "pty", slaves are "tty";
		* the fourth letter is one of pqrstuvwxyzabcde indicating
		  the 1st through 16th series of 16 pseudo-ttys each, and
		* the fifth letter is one of 0123456789abcdef indicating
		  the position within the series.

		These are the old-style (BSD) PTY devices; Unix98
		devices are on major 128 and above and use the PTY
		master multiplex (/dev/ptmx) to acquire a PTY on
		demand.
  
    block	Floppy disks
		  0 = /dev/fd0		First floppy disk autodetect
		  1 = /dev/fd1		Second floppy disk autodetect
		  2 = /dev/fd2		Third floppy disk autodetect
		  3 = /dev/fd3		Fourth floppy disk autodetect

		To specify format, add to the autodetect device number:
		  0 = /dev/fd?		Autodetect format
		  4 = /dev/fd?d360	5.25"  360K in a 360K  drive(1)
		 20 = /dev/fd?h360	5.25"  360K in a 1200K drive(1)
		 48 = /dev/fd?h410	5.25"  410K in a 1200K drive
		 64 = /dev/fd?h420	5.25"  420K in a 1200K drive
		 24 = /dev/fd?h720	5.25"  720K in a 1200K drive
		 80 = /dev/fd?h880	5.25"  880K in a 1200K drive(1)
		  8 = /dev/fd?h1200	5.25" 1200K in a 1200K drive(1)
		 40 = /dev/fd?h1440	5.25" 1440K in a 1200K drive(1)
		 56 = /dev/fd?h1476	5.25" 1476K in a 1200K drive
		 72 = /dev/fd?h1494	5.25" 1494K in a 1200K drive
		 92 = /dev/fd?h1600	5.25" 1600K in a 1200K drive(1)

		 12 = /dev/fd?u360	3.5"   360K Double Density(2)
		 16 = /dev/fd?u720	3.5"   720K Double Density(1)
		120 = /dev/fd?u800	3.5"   800K Double Density(2)
		 52 = /dev/fd?u820	3.5"   820K Double Density
		 68 = /dev/fd?u830	3.5"   830K Double Density
		 84 = /dev/fd?u1040	3.5"  1040K Double Density(1)
		 88 = /dev/fd?u1120	3.5"  1120K Double Density(1)
		 28 = /dev/fd?u1440	3.5"  1440K High Density(1)
		124 = /dev/fd?u1600	3.5"  1600K High Density(1)
		 44 = /dev/fd?u1680	3.5"  1680K High Density(3)
		 60 = /dev/fd?u1722	3.5"  1722K High Density
		 76 = /dev/fd?u1743	3.5"  1743K High Density
		 96 = /dev/fd?u1760	3.5"  1760K High Density
		116 = /dev/fd?u1840	3.5"  1840K High Density(3)
		100 = /dev/fd?u1920	3.5"  1920K High Density(1)
		 32 = /dev/fd?u2880	3.5"  2880K Extra Density(1)
		104 = /dev/fd?u3200	3.5"  3200K Extra Density
		108 = /dev/fd?u3520	3.5"  3520K Extra Density
		112 = /dev/fd?u3840	3.5"  3840K Extra Density(1)

		 36 = /dev/fd?CompaQ	Compaq 2880K drive; obsolete?

		(1) Autodetectable format
		(2) Autodetectable format in a Double Density (720K) drive only
		(3) Autodetectable format in a High Density (1440K) drive only

		NOTE: The letter in the device name (d, q, h or u)
		signifies the type of drive: 5.25" Double Density (d),
		5.25" Quad Density (q), 5.25" High Density (h) or 3.5"
		(any model, u).	 The use of the capital letters D, H
		and E for the 3.5" models have been deprecated, since
		the drive type is insignificant for these devices.

  3 char	Pseudo-TTY slaves
		  0 = /dev/ttyp0	First PTY slave
		  1 = /dev/ttyp1	Second PTY slave
		    ...
		255 = /dev/ttyef	256th PTY slave

		These are the old-style (BSD) PTY devices; Unix98
		devices are on major 136 and above.

    block	First MFM, RLL and IDE hard disk/CD-ROM interface
		  0 = /dev/hda		Master: whole disk (or CD-ROM)
		 64 = /dev/hdb		Slave: whole disk (or CD-ROM)

		For partitions, add to the whole disk device number:
		  0 = /dev/hd?		Whole disk
		  1 = /dev/hd?1		First partition
		  2 = /dev/hd?2		Second partition
		    ...
		 63 = /dev/hd?63	63rd partition

		For Linux/i386, partitions 1-4 are the primary
		partitions, and 5 and above are logical partitions.
		Other versions of Linux use partitioning schemes
		appropriate to their respective architectures.

  4 char	TTY devices
		  0 = /dev/tty0		Current virtual console

		  1 = /dev/tty1		First virtual console
		      ...
		 63 = /dev/tty63	63rd virtual console
		 64 = /dev/ttyS0	First serial port
		      ...
		127 = /dev/ttyS63	64th serial port
		128 = /dev/ptyp0	OBSOLETE
		      ...
		191 = /dev/ptysf	OBSOLETE
		192 = /dev/ttyp0	OBSOLETE
		      ...
		255 = /dev/ttysf	OBSOLETE

		Older versions of the Linux kernel used this major
		number for BSD PTY devices.  As of Linux 2.1.115, this
		is no longer supported.  Use major numbers 2 and 3.

  5 char	Alternate TTY devices
		  0 = /dev/tty		Current TTY device
		  1 = /dev/console	System console
		  2 = /dev/ptmx		PTY master multiplex
		 64 = /dev/cua0		Callout device corresponding to ttyS0
		      ...
		127 = /dev/cua63	Callout device corresponding to ttyS63

		(5,1) is /dev/console starting with Linux 2.1.71.  See
		the section on terminal devices for more information
		on /dev/console.

  6 char	Parallel printer devices
		  0 = /dev/lp0		First parallel printer (0x3bc)
		  1 = /dev/lp1		Second parallel printer (0x378)
		  2 = /dev/lp2		Third parallel printer (0x278)

		Not all computers have the 0x3bc parallel port; hence
		the "first" printer may be either /dev/lp0 or
		/dev/lp1.

  7 char	Virtual console capture devices
		  0 = /dev/vcs		Current vc text contents
		  1 = /dev/vcs1		tty1 text contents
		      ...
		 63 = /dev/vcs63	tty63 text contents
		128 = /dev/vcsa		Current vc text/attribute contents
		129 = /dev/vcsa1	tty1 text/attribute contents
		      ...
		191 = /dev/vcsa63	tty63 text/attribute contents
	
		NOTE: These devices permit both read and write access.

    block	Loopback devices
		  0 = /dev/loop0	First loopback device
		  1 = /dev/loop1	Second loopback device
		      ...

		The loopback devices are used to mount filesystems not
		associated with block devices.	The binding to the
		loopback devices is handled by mount(8) or losetup(8).

  8 block	SCSI disk devices (0-15)
		  0 = /dev/sda		First SCSI disk whole disk
		 16 = /dev/sdb		Second SCSI disk whole disk
		 32 = /dev/sdc		Third SCSI disk whole disk
		      ...
		240 = /dev/sdp		Sixteenth SCSI disk whole disk

		Partitions are handled in the same way as for IDE
		disks (see major number 3) except that the limit on
		partitions is 15.

  9 char	SCSI tape devices
		  0 = /dev/st0		First SCSI tape, mode 0
		  1 = /dev/st1		Second SCSI tape, mode 0
		      ...
		 32 = /dev/st0l		First SCSI tape, mode 1
		 33 = /dev/st1l		Second SCSI tape, mode 1
		      ...
		 64 = /dev/st0m		First SCSI tape, mode 2
		 65 = /dev/st1m		Second SCSI tape, mode 2
		      ...
		 96 = /dev/st0a		First SCSI tape, mode 3
		 97 = /dev/st1a		Second SCSI tape, mode 3
		      ...
		128 = /dev/nst0		First SCSI tape, mode 0, no rewind
		129 = /dev/nst1		Second SCSI tape, mode 0, no rewind
		      ...
		160 = /dev/nst0l	First SCSI tape, mode 1, no rewind
		161 = /dev/nst1l	Second SCSI tape, mode 1, no rewind
		      ...
		192 = /dev/nst0m	First SCSI tape, mode 2, no rewind
		193 = /dev/nst1m	Second SCSI tape, mode 2, no rewind
		      ...
		224 = /dev/nst0a	First SCSI tape, mode 3, no rewind
		225 = /dev/nst1a	Second SCSI tape, mode 3, no rewind
		      ...

		"No rewind" refers to the omission of the default
		automatic rewind on device close.  The MTREW or MTOFFL
		ioctl()'s can be used to rewind the tape regardless of
		the device used to access it.

    block	Metadisk (RAID) devices
		  0 = /dev/md0		First metadisk group
		  1 = /dev/md1		Second metadisk group
		      ...

    block	SCSI CD-ROM devices
		  0 = /dev/sr0		First SCSI CD-ROM
		  1 = /dev/sr1		Second SCSI CD-ROM
		      ...

		The prefix /dev/scd instead of /dev/sr has been used
		as well, and might make more sense.

 12 char	QIC-02 tape
		  2 = /dev/ntpqic11	QIC-11, no rewind-on-close
		  3 = /dev/tpqic11	QIC-11, rewind-on-close
		  4 = /dev/ntpqic24	QIC-24, no rewind-on-close

 ****	ADDITIONAL /dev DIRECTORY ENTRIES

This section details additional entries that should or may exist in
the /dev directory.  It is preferred that symbolic links use the same
form (absolute or relative) as is indicated here.  Links are
classified as "hard" or "symbolic" depending on the preferred type of
link; if possible, the indicated type of link should be used.


	Compulsory links

These links should exist on all systems:

/dev/fd		/proc/self/fd	symbolic	File descriptors
/dev/stdin	fd/0		symbolic	stdin file descriptor
/dev/stdout	fd/1		symbolic	stdout file descriptor
/dev/stderr	fd/2		symbolic	stderr file descriptor
/dev/nfsd	socksys		symbolic	Required by iBCS-2
/dev/X0R	null		symbolic	Required by iBCS-2

Note: the last device is <letter X>-<digit 0>-<letter R>.

	Recommended links

It is recommended that these links exist on all systems:

/dev/core	/proc/kcore	symbolic	Backward compatibility
/dev/ramdisk	ram0		symbolic	Backward compatibility
/dev/ftape	qft0		symbolic	Backward compatibility
/dev/bttv0	video0		symbolic	Backward compatibility
/dev/radio	radio0		symbolic	Backward compatibility
/dev/scd?	sr?		hard		Alternate SCSI CD-ROM name

	Locally defined links

The following links may be established locally to conform to the
configuration of the system.  This is merely a tabulation of existing
practice, and does not constitute a recommendation.  However, if they
exist, they should have the following uses.

/dev/mouse	mouse port	symbolic	Current mouse device
/dev/tape	tape device	symbolic	Current tape device
/dev/cdrom	CD-ROM device	symbolic	Current CD-ROM device
/dev/cdwriter	CD-writer	symbolic	Current CD-writer device
/dev/scanner	scanner		symbolic	Current scanner device
/dev/modem	modem port	symbolic	Current dialout device
/dev/root	root device	symbolic	Current root filesystem
/dev/swap	swap device	symbolic	Current swap device

/dev/modem should not be used for a modem which supports dialin as
well as dialout, as it tends to cause lock file problems.  If it
exists, /dev/modem should point to the appropriate primary TTY device
(the use of the alternate callout devices is deprecated).

For SCSI devices, /dev/tape and /dev/cdrom should point to the
``cooked'' devices (/dev/st* and /dev/sr*, respectively), whereas
/dev/cdwriter and /dev/scanner should point to the appropriate generic
SCSI devices (/dev/sg*).

/dev/mouse may point to a primary serial TTY device, a hardware mouse
device, or a socket for a mouse driver program (e.g. /dev/gpmdata).

	Sockets and pipes

Non-transient sockets and named pipes may exist in /dev.  Common entries are:

/dev/printer	socket		lpd local socket
/dev/log	socket		syslog local socket
/dev/gpmdata	socket		gpm mouse multiplexer


 ****	TERMINAL DEVICES

Terminal, or TTY devices are a special class of character devices.  A
terminal device is any device that could act as a controlling terminal
for a session; this includes virtual consoles, serial ports, and
pseudoterminals (PTYs).

All terminal devices share a common set of capabilities known as line
diciplines; these include the common terminal line dicipline as well
as SLIP and PPP modes.

All terminal devices are named similarly; this section explains the
naming and use of the various types of TTYs.  Note that the naming
conventions include several historical warts; some of these are
Linux-specific, some were inherited from other systems, and some
reflect Linux outgrowing a borrowed convention.

A hash mark (#) in a device name is used here to indicate a decimal
number without leading zeroes.

	Virtual consoles and the console device

Virtual consoles are full-screen terminal displays on the system video
monitor.  Virtual consoles are named /dev/tty#, with numbering
starting at /dev/tty1; /dev/tty0 is the current virtual console.
/dev/tty0 is the device that should be used to access the system video
card on those architectures for which the frame buffer devices
(/dev/fb*) are not applicable.  Do not use /dev/console
for this purpose.

The console device, /dev/console, is the device to which system
messages should be sent, and on which logins should be permitted in
single-user mode.  Starting with Linux 2.1.71, /dev/console is managed
by the kernel; for previous versions it should be a symbolic link to
either /dev/tty0, a specific virtual console such as /dev/tty1, or to
a serial port primary (tty*, not cu*) device, depending on the
configuration of the system.

	Serial ports

Serial ports are RS-232 serial ports and any device which simulates
one, either in hardware (such as internal modems) or in software (such
as the ISDN driver.)  Under Linux, each serial ports has two device
names, the primary or callin device and the alternate or callout one.
Each kind of device is indicated by a different letter.  For any
letter X, the names of the devices are /dev/ttyX# and /dev/cux#,
respectively; for historical reasons, /dev/ttyS# and /dev/ttyC#
correspond to /dev/cua# and /dev/cub#.  In the future, it should be
expected that multiple letters will be used; all letters will be upper
case for the "tty" device (e.g. /dev/ttyDP#) and lower case for the
"cu" device (e.g. /dev/cudp#).

The names /dev/ttyQ# and /dev/cuq# are reserved for local use.

The alternate devices provide for kernel-based exclusion and somewhat
different defaults than the primary devices.  Their main purpose is to
allow the use of serial ports with programs with no inherent or broken
support for serial ports.  Their use is deprecated, and they may be
removed from a future version of Linux.

Arbitration of serial ports is provided by the use of lock files with
the names /var/lock/LCK..ttyX#.  The contents of the lock file should
be the PID of the locking process as an ASCII number.

It is common practice to install links such as /dev/modem
which point to serial ports.  In order to ensure proper locking in the
presence of these links, it is recommended that software chase
symlinks and lock all possible names; additionally, it is recommended
that a lock file be installed with the corresponding alternate
device.  In order to avoid deadlocks, it is recommended that the locks
are acquired in the following order, and released in the reverse:

	1. The symbolic link name, if any (/var/lock/LCK..modem)
	2. The "tty" name (/var/lock/LCK..ttyS2)
	3. The alternate device name (/var/lock/LCK..cua2)

In the case of nested symbolic links, the lock files should be
installed in the order the symlinks are resolved.

Under no circumstances should an application hold a lock while waiting
for another to be released.  In addition, applications which attempt
to create lock files for the corresponding alternate device names
should take into account the possibility of being used on a non-serial
port TTY, for which no alternate device would exist.

	Pseudoterminals (PTYs)

Pseudoterminals, or PTYs, are used to create login sessions or provide
other capabilities requiring a TTY line dicipline (including SLIP or
PPP capability) to arbitrary data-generation processes.  Each PTY has
a master side, named /dev/pty[p-za-e][0-9a-f], and a slave side, named
/dev/tty[p-za-e][0-9a-f].  The kernel arbitrates the use of PTYs by
allowing each master side to be opened only once.

Once the master side has been opened, the corresponding slave device
can be used in the same manner as any TTY device.  The master and
slave devices are connected by the kernel, generating the equivalent
of a bidirectional pipe with TTY capabilities.

Recent versions of the Linux kernels and GNU libc contain support for
the System V/Unix98 naming scheme for PTYs, which assigns a common
device, /dev/ptmx, to all the masters (opening it will automatically
give you a previously unassigned PTY) and a subdirectory, /dev/pts,
for the slaves; the slaves are named with decimal integers (/dev/pts/#
in our notation).  This removes the problem of exhausting the
namespace and enables the kernel to automatically create the device
nodes for the slaves on demand using the "devpts" filesystem.
