		       LINUX ALLOCATED DEVICES

	     Maintained by H. Peter Anvin <hpa@zytor.com>

		      Last revised: June 9, 1996

This list is the successor to Rick Miller's Linux Device List, which
he stopped maintaining when he got busy with other things in 1993.  It
is a registry of allocated major device numbers, as well as the
recommended /dev directory nodes for these devices.

The latest version of this list is included with the Linux kernel
sources in LaTeX and ASCII form.  In case of discrepancy, the LaTeX
version is authoritative.

This document is included by reference into the Linux Filesystem
Standard (FSSTND).  The FSSTND is available via FTP from
tsx-11.mit.edu in the directory /pub/linux/docs/linux-standards/fsstnd.

To have a major number allocated, or a minor number in situations
where that applies (e.g. busmice), please contact me with the
appropriate device information.  Also, if you have additional
information regarding any of the devices listed below, or if I have
made a mistake, I would greatly appreciate a note.

Allocations marked (68k/Amiga) apply to Linux/68k on the Amiga
platform only.  Allocations marked (68k/Atari) apply to Linux/68k on
the Atari platform only.

This document is in the public domain.  The author requests, however,
that semantically altered versions are not distributed without
permission of the author, assuming the author can be contacted without
an unreasonable effort.

In particular, please don't sent patches for this list to Linus, at
least not without contacting me first.

I do not have any information about these devices beyond what appears
on this list.  Any such information requests will be deleted without
reply.

  0 		Unnamed devices (e.g. non-device mounts)
		  0 = reserved as null device number

		 36 = /dev/fd?CompaQ	Compaq 2880K drive; obsolete?

		(1) Autodetectable format
		(2) Autodetectable format in a Double Density (720K) drive only
		(3) Autodetectable format in a High Density (1440K) drive only

		NOTE: The letter in the device name (d, q, h or u)
		signifies the type of drive: 5.25" Double Density (d),
		5.25" Quad Density (q), 5.25" High Density (h) or 3.5"
		(any model, u).  The use of the capital letters D, H
		and E for the 3.5" models have been deprecated, since
		the drive type is insignificant for these devices.

  3 char	Pseudo-TTY slaves
		  0 = /dev/ttyp0	First PTY slave
		  1 = /dev/ttyp1	Second PTY slave
		    ...
		256 = /dev/ttyef	256th PTY slave

    block	First MFM, RLL and IDE hard disk/CD-ROM interface
    		  0 = /dev/hda		Master: whole disk (or CD-ROM)
		 64 = /dev/hdb		Slave: whole disk (or CD-ROM)
		
		For partitions, add to the whole disk device number:
		  0 = /dev/hd?		Whole disk
		  1 = /dev/hd?1		First partition
		  2 = /dev/hd?2		Second partition
		    ...
		 63 = /dev/hd?63	63rd partition

		For Linux/i386, partitions 1-4 are the primary
		partitions, and 5 and above are logical partitions.
		Other versions of Linux use partitioning schemes
		appropriate to their respective architectures.
		
  4 char	TTY devices
    		  0 = /dev/console	Console device

		  1 = /dev/tty1		First virtual console
		      ...

		192 = /dev/ttyp0	First pseudo-tty slave
		      ...
		255 = /dev/ttysf	64th pseudo-tty slave

		For compatibility with previous versions of Linux, the
		first 64 PTYs are replicated under this device
		number.  This use will be obsolescent with the release
		of Linux 1.4 and may be removed in a future version of
		Linux.

  5 char	Alternate TTY devices

		  1 = /dev/lp1		Second parallel printer (0x378)
		  2 = /dev/lp2		Third parallel printer (0x278)

		Not all computers have the 0x3bc parallel port; hence
		the "first" printer may be either /dev/lp0 or
		/dev/lp1.

  7 char	Virtual console capture devices
    		  0 = /dev/vcs		Current vc text contents
		  1 = /dev/vcs1		tty1 text contents

    		  0 = /dev/sda		First SCSI disk whole disk
		 16 = /dev/sdb		Second SCSI disk whole disk
		 32 = /dev/sdc		Third SCSI disk whole disk
  		      ...
		240 = /dev/sdp		Sixteenth SCSI disk whole disk

		disks (see major number 3) except that the limit on
		partitions is 15.

  9 char	SCSI tape devices
    		  0 = /dev/st0		First SCSI tape, mode 0
		  1 = /dev/st1		Second SCSI tape, mode 0
		      ...
    		 32 = /dev/st0l		First SCSI tape, mode 1

		      ...
    		 64 = /dev/st0m		First SCSI tape, mode 2
		 65 = /dev/st1m		Second SCSI tape, mode 2
		      ...
    		 96 = /dev/st0a		First SCSI tape, mode 3
		 97 = /dev/st1a		Second SCSI tape, mode 3
		      ...
		128 = /dev/nst0		First SCSI tape, mode 0, no rewind
		129 = /dev/nst1		Second SCSI tape, mode 0, no rewind
		      ...
		160 = /dev/nst0l	First SCSI tape, mode 1, no rewind

		193 = /dev/nst1m	Second SCSI tape, mode 2, no rewind
		      ...
		224 = /dev/nst0a	First SCSI tape, mode 3, no rewind
		225 = /dev/nst1a	Second SCSI tape, mode 3, no rewind
		      ...

		"No rewind" refers to the omission of the default
		automatic rewind on device close.  The MTREW or MTOFFL
		ioctl()'s can be used to rewind the tape regardless of
		the device used to access it.

    block	Metadisk (RAID) devices
		  0 = /dev/md0		First metadisk group
		  1 = /dev/md1		Second metadisk group

		device accesses the frame buffer at current resolution
		(Linux/68k calls this device "current",
		e.g. /dev/fb0current); the "autodetect" one at bootup
		(default) resolution.  Minor numbers 2-23 within each
		frame buffer assignment are used for specific
		device-dependent resolutions.  There appears to be no
		standard naming for these devices.  Finally, 2-31
		within each device are reserved for user-selected
		modes, usually entered at boot time.  Currently only
		Linux/68k uses the mode-specific devices.

	ADDITIONAL /dev DIRECTORY ENTRIES

This section details additional entries that should or may exist in
the /dev directory.  It is preferred that symbolic links use the same
form (absolute or relative) as is indicated here.  Links are
classified as "hard" or "symbolic" depending on the preferred type of
link; if possible, the indicated type of link should be used.


	Compulsory links

These links should exist on all systems:

/dev/fd		/proc/self/fd	symbolic	File descriptors
/dev/stdin	fd/0		symbolic	stdin file descriptor
/dev/stdout	fd/1		symbolic	stdout file descriptor
/dev/stderr	fd/2		symbolic	stderr file descriptor
/dev/nfsd	socksys		symbolic	Required by iBCS-2
/dev/X0R	null		symbolic	Required by iBCS-2

Note: the last device is <letter X>-<digit 0>-<letter R>.

	Recommended links

It is recommended that these links exist on all systems:

/dev/core	/proc/kcore	symbolic	Backward compatibility
/dev/ramdisk	ram0		symbolic	Backward compatibility
/dev/ftape	rft0		symbolic	Backward compatibility
/dev/scd?	sr?		hard		Alternate SCSI CD-ROM name


	Locally defined links

The following links may be established locally to conform to the
configuration of the system.  This is merely a tabulation of existing
practice, and does not constitute a recommendation.  However, if they
exist, they should have the following uses.

/dev/mouse	mouse port	symbolic	Current mouse device
/dev/tape	tape device	symbolic	Current tape device
/dev/cdrom	CD-ROM device	symbolic	Current CD-ROM device
/dev/cdwriter	CD-writer	symbolic	Current CD-writer device
/dev/scanner	scanner		symbolic	Current scanner device
/dev/modem	modem port	symbolic	Current dialout device
/dev/root	root device	symbolic	Current root filesystem
/dev/swap	swap device	symbolic	Current swap device

/dev/modem should not be used for a modem which supports dialin as
well as dialout, as it tends to cause lock file problems.  If it
exists, /dev/modem should point to the appropriate dialout (alternate)
device.

For SCSI devices, /dev/tape and /dev/cdrom should point to the
``cooked'' devices (/dev/st* and /dev/sr*, respectively), whereas
/dev/cdwriter and /dev/scanner should point to the appropriate generic
SCSI devices (/dev/sg*).

/dev/mouse may point to a primary serial TTY device, a hardware mouse
device, or a socket for a mouse driver program (e.g. /dev/gpmdata).

	Sockets and pipes

Non-transient sockets and named pipes may exist in /dev.  Common entries are:

/dev/printer	socket		lpd local socket
/dev/log	socket		syslog local socket
/dev/gpmdata	socket		gpm mouse multiplexer
