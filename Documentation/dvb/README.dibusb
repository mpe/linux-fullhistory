NEWS:
  2004-09-13 - added support for a new device (Artec T1 USB TVBOX), thanks
               to Christian Motschke for reporting
  2004-09-05 - released the dibusb device and dib3000mb-frontend driver

  (old news for vp7041.c)
  2004-07-15 - found out, by accident, that the device has a TUA6010XS for
               frequency generator
  2004-07-12 - figured out, that the driver should also work with the
               CTS Portable (Chinese Television System)
  2004-07-08 - firmware-extraction-2.422-problem solved, driver is now working
               properly with firmware extracted from 2.422
			 - #if for 2.6.4 (dvb), compile issue
			 - changed firmware handling, see vp7041.txt sec 1.1
  2004-07-02 - some tuner modifications, v0.1, cleanups, first public
  2004-06-28 - now using the dvb_dmx_swfilter_packets, everything
               runs fine now
  2004-06-27 - able to watch and switching channels (pre-alpha)
             - no section filtering yet
  2004-06-06 - first TS received, but kernel oops :/
  2004-05-14 - firmware loader is working
  2004-05-11 - start writing the driver

1. How to use?
NOTE: This driver was developed using Linux 2.6.6.,
it is working with 2.6.7, 2.6.8.1.

Linux 2.4.x support is not planned, but patches are very welcome.

NOTE: I'm using Debian testing, so the following explaination (especially
the hotplug-path) needn't match your system, but probably it will :).

1.1. Firmware

The USB driver needs to download a firmware to start working.

You can either use "get_dvb_firmware dibusb" to download the firmware or you
can get it directly via

http://linuxtv.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/dvb-kernel/firmware/dvb-dibusb-5.0.0.11.fw?rev=1.1&content-type=text/plain

1.2. Compiling

Since the driver is in the linux kernel, activating the driver in
your favorite config-environment should sufficient. I recommend
to compile the driver as module. Hotplug does the rest.

1.3. Loading the drivers

Hotplug is able to load the driver, when it is needed (because you plugged
in the device).

If you want to enable debug output, you have to load the driver manually.

modprobe dvb-dibusb debug=1
modprobe dib3000mb debug=1

should do the trick.

When the driver is loaded successfully, the firmware file was in
the right place and the device is connected, the "Power"-LED should be
turned on.

At this point you should be able to start a dvb-capable application. For myself
I used mplayer, dvbscan, tzap and kaxtv, they are working. Using the device
as a slave device in vdr, was not working for me. Some work has to be done
(patches and comments are very welcome).

2. Known problems and bugs

TODO:
- add some additional URBs for USB data transfer
- due a firmware problem i2c writes during mpeg transfers destroy the stream
  no i2c writes during streaming, interrupt streaming, when adding another pid

2.1. Adding new devices

It is not possible to determine the range of devices based on the DiBcom
reference design. This is because the reference design of DiBcom can be sold
to third persons, without telling DiBcom (so done with the Twinhan VP7041 and
the HAMA device).

When you think you have a device like this and the driver does not recognizes it,
please send the ****load.inf and the ****cap.inf of the Windows driver to me.

Sometimes the Vendor or Product ID is identical to the ones of Twinhan, even
though it is not a Twinhan device (e.g. HAMA), then please send me the name
of the device. I will add it to this list in order to make this clear to
others.

If you are familar with C you can also add the VID and PID of the device to
the dvb-dibusb.[hc]-files and create a patch and send it over to me or to
the linux-dvb mailing list, _after_ you have tried compiling and modprobing
it.

2.2. Comments

Patches, comments and suggestions are very very welcome
