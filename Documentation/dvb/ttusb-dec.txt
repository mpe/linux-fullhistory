Getting the Firmware
--------------------
Currently, the driver only works with v2.15a of the firmware.  The firmwares
can be obtained in this way:

wget http://hauppauge.lightpath.net/de/dec215a.exe
unzip -j dec215a.exe Software/Oem/STB/App/Boot/STB_PC_T.bin
unzip -j dec215a.exe Software/Oem/STB/App/Boot/STB_PC_S.bin


Compilation Notes for 2.4 kernels
---------------------------------
For 2.4 kernels the firmware for the DECs is compiled into the driver itself.
The firmwares are expected to be in /etc/dvb at compilation time.

mv STB_PC_T.bin /etc/dvb/dec2000t.bin
mv STB_PC_S.bin /etc/dvb/dec3000s.bin


Hotplug Firmware Loading for 2.6 kernels
----------------------------------------
For 2.6 kernels the firmware is loaded at the point that the driver module is
loaded.  See linux/Documentation/dvb/firmware.txt for more information.

mv STB_PC_T.bin /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/dvb-ttusb-dec-2000t-2.15a.fw
mv STB_PC_S.bin /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/dvb-ttusb-dec-3000s-2.15a.fw
