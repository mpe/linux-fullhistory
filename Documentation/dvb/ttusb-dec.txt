TechnoTrend/Hauppauge DEC USB Driver
====================================

Driver Status
-------------

Supported:
	DEC2000-t
	Linux Kernels 2.4 and 2.6
	Video Streaming
	Audio Streaming
	Channel Zapping
	Hotplug firmware loader under 2.6 kernels

In Progress:
	DEC3000-s

To Do:
	Section data
	Teletext streams
	Tuner status information
	DVB network interface
	Streaming video PC->DEC

Note:	Since section data can not be retreived yet, scan apps will not work.

Getting the Firmware
--------------------
Currently, the driver only works with v2.15a of the firmware.  The firmwares
can be obtained in this way:

wget http://hauppauge.lightpath.net/de/dec215a.exe
unzip -j dec215a.exe Software/Oem/STB/App/Boot/STB_PC_T.bin
unzip -j dec215a.exe Software/Oem/STB/App/Boot/STB_PC_S.bin


Compilation Notes for 2.4 kernels
---------------------------------
For 2.4 kernels the firmware for the DECs is compiled into the driver itself.
The firmwares are expected to be in /etc/dvb at compilation time.

mv STB_PC_T.bin /etc/dvb/dec2000t.bin
mv STB_PC_S.bin /etc/dvb/dec3000s.bin


Hotplug Firmware Loading for 2.6 kernels
----------------------------------------
For 2.6 kernels the firmware is loaded at the point that the driver module is
loaded.  See linux/Documentation/dvb/FIRMWARE for more information.

mv STB_PC_T.bin /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/dec2000t.bin
mv STB_PC_S.bin /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/dec3000s.bin
