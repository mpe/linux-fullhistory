June 1999		  Kernel Parameters			v2.2.9
			  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is a consolidated list of the kernel parameters as defined
in the file init/main.c and sorted into English Dictionary order (defined
as ignoring all punctuation and sorting digits before letters in a case
insensitive manner), and with descriptions where known.

The text in square brackets at the beginning of the description state the
restrictions on the kernel for the said kernel parameter to be valid. The
restrictions referred to are that the relevant option is valid if:

    APIC	APIC support is enabled.
    APM 	Advanced Power Management support is enabled.
    AX25	Appropriate AX.25 support is enabled.
    CD		Appropriate CD support is enabled.
    EIDE	EIDE/ATAPI support is enabled.
    FB		The frame buffer device is enabled.
    HW		Appropriate hardware is enabled.
    ISDN	Appropriate ISDN support is enabled.
    JOY 	Appropriate joystick support is enabled.
    LP		Printer support is enabled.
    MCA 	MCA bus support is enabled.
    MDA 	The MDA console is enabled.
    MOUSE	Appropriate mouse support is enabled.
    NET 	Appropriate network support is enabled.
    NFS 	Appropriate NFS support is enabled.
    PARIDE	The ParIDE subsystem is enabled.
    PCI 	PCI bus support is enabled.
    PCMCIA	The PCMCIA subsystem is enabled.
    PNP 	Plug & Play support is enabled.
    PPT		Parallel port support is enabled.
    PS2 	Appropriate PS/2 support is enabled.
    RAM 	RAMdisc support is enabled.
    SCSI	Appropriate SCSI support is enabled.
    SERIAL	Serial support is enabled.
    SMP 	The kernel is an SMP kernel.
    SOUND	Appropriate sound system support is enabled.
    VGA 	The VGA console has been enabled.
    VT		Virtual terminal support is enabled.
    XT		IBM PC/XT MFM hard disk support is enabled.

In addition, the following text indicates that the option:

    BUGS=	Relates to possible processor bugs on the said processor.
    KNL 	Is a kernel start-up parameter.

Note that ALL kernel parameters listed below are CASE SENSITIVE, and that
a trailing = on the name of any parameter states that that parameter will
be entered as an environment variable, whereas its absence indicates that
it will appear as a kernel argument readable via /proc/cmdline by programs
running once the system is up.

    lp=0 		[LP] Specify parallel ports to use, e.g,
or  lp=port[,port...]	lp=none,parport0 (lp0 not configured, lp1 uses
or  lp=reset		first parallel port).  'lp=0' disables the printer
or  lp=auto		driver.  'lp=reset' (which can be specified in
			addition to the ports) causes attached
			printers to be reset.  Using
			lp=port1,port2,... specifies the parallel
			ports to associate lp devices with, starting
			with lp0.  A port specification may be 'none'
			to skip that lp device, or a parport name such
			as 'parport0'.  Specifying 'lp=auto' instead
			of a port specification list means that device
			IDs from each port should be examined, to see
			if an IEEE 1284-compliant printer is attached;
			if so, the driver will manage that printer.

			an SMP kernel should make use of.

			emulation library even if a 387 maths coprocessor
			is present.

    noapic		[SMP,APIC] Tells the kernel not to make use of any
			APIC that may be present on the system.

			initial ramdisc.

    nosmp		[SMP] Tells an SMP kernel to act as a UP kernel.

    optcd=		[HW,CD]

    panic=		

    parport=0			[HW,PPT] Specify parallel ports.  0
or  parport=auto		disables.  Use 'auto' to force the driver
or  parport=0xBBB[,IRQ[,DMA]]	to use any IRQ/DMA settings detected
				(the default is to ignore detected
				IRQ/DMA settings because of possible
				conflicts).  You can specify the base
				address, IRQ, and DMA settings; IRQ
				and DMA should be numbers, or 'auto'
				(for using detected settings on that
				particular port), or 'nofifo' (to
				avoid using a FIFO even if it is
				detected).  Parallel ports are
				assigned in the order they are
				specified on the command line,
				starting with parport0.
