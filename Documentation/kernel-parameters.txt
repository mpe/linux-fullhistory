June 1999		  Kernel Parameters			v2.2.9
			  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is a consolidated list of the kernel parameters as defined
in the file init/main.c and sorted into English Dictionary order (defined
as ignoring all punctuation and sorting digits before letters in a case
insensitive manner), and with descriptions where known.

The text in square brackets at the beginning of the description state the
restrictions on the kernel for the said kernel parameter to be valid. The
restrictions referred to are that the relevant option is valid if:

    APIC	APIC support is enabled.
    APM 	Automatic Power Management support is enabled.
    AX25	Appropriate AX.25 support is enabled.
    CD		Appropriate CD support is enabled.
    EIDE	EIDE/ATAPI support is enabled.
    FB		The frame buffer device is enabled.
    HW		Appropriate hardware is enabled.
    ISDN	Appropriate ISDN support is enabled.
    JOY 	Appropriate joystick support is enabled.
    LPT 	Printer support is enabled.
    MCA 	MCA bus support is enabled.
    MDA 	The MDA console is enabled.
    MOUSE	Appropriate mouse support is enabled.
    NET 	Appropriate network support is enabled.
    NFS 	Appropriate NFS support is enabled.
    PARIDE	The ParIDE subsystem is enabled.
    PCI 	PCI bus support is enabled.
    PCMCIA	The PCMCIA subsystem is enabled.
    PNP 	Plug & Play support is enabled.
    PS2 	Appropriate PS/2 support is enabled.
    RAM 	RAMdisc support is enabled.
    SCSI	Appropriate SCSI support is enabled.
    SERIAL	Serial support is enabled.
    SMP 	The kernel is an SMP kernel.
    SOUND	Appropriate sound system support is enabled.
    VGA 	The VGA console has been enabled.
    VT		Virtual terminal support is enabled.
    XT		IBM PC/XT MFM hard disk support is enabled.

In addition, the following text indicates that the option:

    BUGS=	Relates to possible processor bugs on the said processor.
    KNL 	Is a kernel start-up parameter.

Note that ALL kernel parameters listed below are CASE SENSITIVE, and that
a trailing = on the name of any parameter states that that parameter will
be entered as an environment variable, whereas its absence indicates that
it will appear as a kernel argument readable via /proc/cmdline by programs
running once the system is up.
