June 2000		  Kernel Parameters			v2.4.0
			  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is a consolidated list of the kernel parameters as implemented
by the __setup() macro and sorted into English Dictionary order (defined      
as ignoring all punctuation and sorting digits before letters in a case
insensitive manner), and with descriptions where known.

The text in square brackets at the beginning of the description state the
restrictions on the kernel for the said kernel parameter to be valid. The
restrictions referred to are that the relevant option is valid if:

	ACPI    ACPI support is enabled.
	APIC	APIC support is enabled.
	APM 	Advanced Power Management support is enabled.
	AX25	Appropriate AX.25 support is enabled.
	CD	Appropriate CD support is enabled.
	DEVFS   devfs support is enabled. 
	DRM	Direct Rendering Management support is enabled. 
	EIDE	EIDE/ATAPI support is enabled.
	FB	The frame buffer device is enabled.
	HW	Appropriate hardware is enabled.
	ISDN	Appropriate ISDN support is enabled.
	JOY 	Appropriate joystick support is enabled.
	LP	Printer support is enabled.
	LOOP	Loopback device support is enabled.
	M68k	M68k architecture is enabled. 
	MCA 	MCA bus support is enabled.
	MDA 	MDA console support is enabled.
	MOUSE	Appropriate mouse support is enabled.
	NET 	Appropriate network support is enabled.
	NFS 	Appropriate NFS support is enabled.
	PARIDE	The ParIDE subsystem is enabled.
	PCI 	PCI bus support is enabled.
	PCMCIA	The PCMCIA subsystem is enabled.
	PNP 	Plug & Play support is enabled.
	PPT	Parallel port support is enabled.
	PS2 	Appropriate PS/2 support is enabled.
	RAM 	RAM disk support is enabled.
	SCSI	Appropriate SCSI support is enabled.
	SERIAL	Serial support is enabled.
	SMP 	The kernel is an SMP kernel.
	SOUND	Appropriate sound system support is enabled.
	VGA 	The VGA console has been enabled.
	VT	Virtual terminal support is enabled.
	XT	IBM PC/XT MFM hard disk support is enabled.

In addition, the following text indicates that the option:

	BUGS=	Relates to possible processor bugs on the said processor.
	KNL 	Is a kernel start-up parameter.

Note that ALL kernel parameters listed below are CASE SENSITIVE, and that
a trailing = on the name of any parameter states that that parameter will
be entered as an environment variable, whereas its absence indicates that
it will appear as a kernel argument readable via /proc/cmdline by programs
running once the system is up.

	lp=0		[LP]	Specify parallel ports to use, e.g,
	lp=port[,port...]	lp=none,parport0 (lp0 not configured, lp1 uses
	lp=reset		first parallel port). 'lp=0' disables the
	lp=auto			printer driver. 'lp=reset' (which can be
				specified in addition to the ports) causes
				attached printers to be reset. Using
				lp=port1,port2,... specifies the parallel ports
				to associate lp devices with, starting with
				lp0. A port specification may be 'none' to skip
				that lp device, or a parport name such as
				'parport0'. Specifying 'lp=auto' instead of a
				port specification list means that device IDs
				from each port should be examined, to see if
				an IEEE 1284-compliant printer is attached; if
				so, the driver will manage that printer.

					settings because of possible
					conflicts). You can specify the base
					address, IRQ, and DMA settings; IRQ and
					DMA should be numbers, or 'auto' (for
					using detected settings on that
					particular port), or 'nofifo' (to avoid
					using a FIFO even if it is detected).

					order they are specified on the command
					line, starting with parport0.
