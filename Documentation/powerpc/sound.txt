            Information about PowerPC Sound support
=====================================================================

Please mail me me (Cort Dougan, cort@cs.nmt.edu) if you have questions,
comments or corrections.

This just covers sound on the PReP systems for now, and later will
contain information on the PowerMac's.

Sound has been tested and is working with the PowerStack and IBM Power
Series onboard sound systems which are based on the cs4231(2) chip.
The sound options when doing the make config are a bit different from the
default, though.

The I/O base, irq and dma lines that you enter during the make config
are ignored and are set when booting according to the machine type.
This is so that one binary can be used for Motorola and IBM machines
which use different values and isn't allowed by the driver, so things are
hacked together in such a way as to allow this information to be set
automatically on boot.

1. PowerStack

  Enable support for "Crystal CS4232 based (PnP) cards".  Although the
  options you set are ignored and determined automatically on boot these
  are included for information only:

  (830) CS4232 audio I/O base 530, 604, E80 or F40
  (10) CS4232 audio IRQ 5, 7, 9, 11, 12 or 15
  (6) CS4232 audio DMA 0, 1 or 3
  (7) CS4232 second (duplex) DMA 0, 1 or 3

  This will allow simultaneous record and playback, as 2 different dma
  channels are used.

  Midi is not supported since the cs4232 driver doesn't support midi yet.

2. IBM machines

  I've only tested sound on the Power Personal Series of IBM workstations
  so if you try it on others please let me know the result.

  Enable support for "Crystal CS4232 based (PnP) cards".  Although the
  options you set are ignored and determined automatically on boot these
  are included for information only:

  (530) CS4232 audio I/O base 530, 604, E80 or F40
  (5) CS4232 audio IRQ 5, 7, 9, 11, 12 or 15
  (1) CS4232 audio DMA 0, 1 or 3
  (7) CS4232 second (duplex) DMA 0, 1 or 3
  (330) CS4232 MIDI I/O base 330, 370, 3B0 or 3F0
  (9) CS4232 MIDI IRQ 5, 7, 9, 11, 12 or 15

  This setup does _NOT_ allow for recording yet.

  Midi is not supported since the cs4232 driver doesn't support midi yet.
