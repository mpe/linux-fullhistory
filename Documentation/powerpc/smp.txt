                 Information about Linux/PPC SMP mode
=====================================================================

This document and the related code was written by me (Cort Dougan), please
email me (cort@cs.nmt.edu) if you have questions, comments or corrections.

SMP support for Linux/PPC is still in its early stages and likely to
be buggy for a while.  If you want to help by writing code or testing
different hardware please email me!

1. State of Supported Hardware

  UMAX s900
    The second processor on this machine boots up just fine and
    enters its idle loop.  Hopefully a completely working SMP kernel
    on this machine will be done shortly.

  BeBox
    BeBox support hasn't been added to the 2.1.X kernels from 2.0.X
    but work is being done and SMP support for BeBox is in the works.
