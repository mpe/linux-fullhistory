The Linux Digiboard Driver
--------------------------

The Digiboard Driver for Linux supports the following boards:

 DigiBoard PC/Xe, PC/Xi, PC/Xeve

Limitations:
------------
Currently the Driver does not do autoprobing. You have to configure
the driver with the correct I/O address in drivers/char/pcxxconfig.h.

The preconfigured I/O address is 0200h and the default memory address 0D0000h.
Use them and you will not have to worry about configuring anything.

Supporting Tools:
-----------------
Some tools and more detailed up to date information can be found at
ftp://ftp.fuller.edu/Linux/digi

The "ditty" tool described in the Digiboard Manuals for other Unixes
is also available.

Currently the Linux MAKEDEV command does not support generating the Digiboard
Devices. Use the following script to generate the devices:

------------------ mkdigidev begin
#!/bin/sh
#
# Script to create Digiboard Devices
# Christoph Lameter, April 4, 1996
#
# Usage:
# mkdigidev [<number of devices>]
# 

DIGIMAJOR=30
DIGICUMAJOR=31

BOARDS=$1

if [ "$BOARDS" = "" ]; then
BOARDS=1
fi

boardnum=0
while [ $boardnum -lt $BOARDS ];
do
  for c in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15;
  do
	name=`expr $boardnum \* 16 + $c`
	mknod /dev/ttyd$name c $DIGIMAJOR $name
	mknod /dev/ttyD$name c $DIGICUMAJOR $name
  done
  boardnum=`expr $boardnum + 1`
done
------------------ mkdigidev end

The ttyd devices behave like the /dev/cua?? devices
and the ttyD devices are like the /dev/ttyS?? devices.
