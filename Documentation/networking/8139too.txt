	      Architectures supported (all PCI platforms):
		    x86, Alpha AXP, PowerPC, Sparc64

		    Kernel versions supported: 2.4.x



Disclaimer
----------

DO NOT CONTACT DONALD BECKER FOR SUPPORT OF THIS DRIVER, his driver is
completely different and maintained independently of the 8139too code base.



Requirements
------------
Kernel 2.4.3 or later.
A Fast Ethernet adapter containing an RTL8139-based chip.



Introduction
------------

The "8139too" Fast Ethernet driver for Linux 2.4.0 is a substantial
modification of the experimental rtl8139 driver from Donald Becker,
some versions of which appeared in 2.2.x and 2.3.x kernels.  The
RTL-8139 is a very low-cost Fast Ethernet chip, which makes it very
popular.

The step from 2.2.x to 2.4.x kernels brings many new features to Linux
device drivers.  Features for MMIO resources, a standard hot-plug API,
and other interfaces are now becoming requirements, as drivers move
off the x86 platform.  With that in mind, I have begun updating the
RTL-8139 driver to current 2.3.x (2.4) kernel standards and APIs, and
fixing the problems that users have been encountering.



Features of 8139too
-------------------
[note - this list intended for people familiar with kernel drivers]

** 100% MMIO, for full speed operation.  All users (so far) have
reported performance increases over their existing RTL drivers.

** Multi-platform support:  x86, Alpha, PPC, ...

** Use proper SMP spinlocking, fixing SMP interrupt bugs, making the
driver portable to non-x86 SMP platforms in the process.

** Use new PCI driver API for seamless, low-maintenance hot-plug support

** Several bugs fixes from original rtl8139 1.08r (October 5, 1999),
including the very common "transmit timeout" problem.

* Use new resource allocation API, required for hot-plug support
* Use new register read/write macros
* initcall support (module_init/exit)
* vastly improved debug tracing support
* code formatting in many places for readability
* use new init_etherdev() facilities

...and probably some other less important changes which I forgot.



Installation
------------

OPTION 1: Build inside kernel tree (into kernel image, or as module)

	(overwrite 8139too driver in kernel tree with different version)
	1) cp 8139too.c $my_source_tree/drivers/net/8139too.c

OPTION 2: Build outside kernel tree

	Use the included Makefile.

Submitting Bug Reports
----------------------
Obtain and compile the modified rtl8139-diag source code from the
8139too driver Web site, http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/
This diagnostics programs, originally from Donald Becker, has been
modified to display all registers on your RTL8139 chip, not just the
first 0x80.

If possible, send the output of a working and broken driver with
	rtl8139-diag -mmaaavvveefN > my-output-file.txt

Send "lspci -vvv" or "cat /proc/pci" output for PCI information.



Known Bugs / Errata / To-Do
---------------------------
The following issues are known, and are actively being pursued.  Patches
to resolve these issues is welcome.  If a problem occurs which is not in
the list, please report it.  That's why we do beta releases, after all...



1) Work with Donald to merge fixes and updates into his driver.

2) ETHTOOL_SSET support

3) PPC platform has stability problems. (XXX: verify this is still true)

4) Sparc64 platform not tested at all.

8) Much improved command line / module parameter setup.  (patches and
suggestions welcome)  (WIP)

9) Better documentation.  (patches welcome)

12) 10base-T support flaky or slow (todo: verify this is still true)

  by using atomic variables.  Use spin_lock_irq instead of
  spin_lock_irq{save,restore} in select places, for better performance.
