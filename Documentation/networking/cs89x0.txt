1.0 CRYSTAL LAN CS8900/CS8920 ETHERNET ADAPTERS
===============================================================================


1.1 PRODUCT OVERVIEW

The CS8900-based ISA Ethernet Adapters from Crystal Semiconductor follow 
IEEE 802.3 standards and support half or full-duplex operation in ISA bus 
computers on 10 Mbps Ethernet networks.  The adapters are designed for 
operation in 16-bit ISA or EISA bus expansion slots and are available in 
10BaseT-only or 3-media configurations (10BaseT, 10Base2, and AUI for 10Base-5
or fiber networks).  

CS8920-based adapters are similar to the CS8900-based adapter with additional 
features for Plug and Play (PnP) support and Wakeup Frame recognition.  As 
such, the configuration procedures differ somewhat between the two types of 
adapters.  Refer to the "Adapter Configuration" section for details on 
configuring both types of adapters.


1.2 DRIVER DESCRIPTION

2.0 ADAPTER INSTALLATION and CONFIGURATION
===============================================================================

Both the CS8900 and CS8920-based adapters can be configured using parameters 
stored in an on-board EEPROM. You must use the DOS-based CS8900/20 Setup 
Utility if you want to change the adapter's configuration in EEPROM.  

When loading the driver as a module, you can specify many of the adapter's 
configuration parameters on the command-line to override the EEPROM's settings 
or for interface configuration when an EEPROM is not used. (CS8920-based 
adapters must use an EEPROM.) See Section 3.0 LOADING THE DRIVER AS A MODULE.

Since the CS8900/20 Setup Utility is a DOS-based application, you must install 
and configure the adapter in a DOS-based system using the CS8900/20 Setup 
Utility before installation in the target LINUX system.  (Not required if 
installing a CS8900-based adapter and the default configuration is acceptable.)
     

2.1 CS8900-BASED ADAPTER CONFIGURATION

CS8900-based adapters shipped from Crystal Semiconductor have been configured 
with the following "default" settings:

  Operation Mode:      Memory Mode
  IRQ:                 10
  Base I/O Address:    300
  Memory Base Address: D0000
  Optimization:	       DOS Client
  Transmission Mode:   Half-duplex
  BootProm:            None
  Media Type:	       Autodetect (3-media cards) or 
                       10BASE-T (10BASE-T only adapter)

You should only change the default configuration settings if conflicts with 
another adapter exist. To change the adapter's configuration, run the 
CS8900/20 Setup Utility. 


2.2 CS8920-BASED ADAPTER CONFIGURATION

CS8920-based adapters are shipped from Crystal Semiconductor configured as Plug
and Play (PnP) enabled.  However, since Linux is not currently a PnP compatible 
operating system, you must install the CS8920 adapter in a DOS-based PC and 
run the CS8900/20 Setup Utility to disable PnP and configure the adapter before
installation in the target Linux system.  Failure to do this will leave the 
adapter inactive and the driver will be unable to communicate with the
adapter.

        ****************************************************************




3.0 LOADING THE DRIVER AS A MODULE
===============================================================================

If the driver is compiled as a loadable module, you can load the driver module
with the 'insmod' command.  Many of the adapter's configuration parameters can 
be specified as command-line arguments to the load command.  This facility 
provides a means to override the EEPROM's settings or for interface 
configuration when an EEPROM is not used.

Example:

    insmod cs89x0.o io=0x200 irq=0xA media=aui

This example loads the module and configures the adapter to use an IO port base
address of 200h, interrupt 10, and use the AUI media connection.  The following
configuration options are available on the command line:

* io=###              - specify IO address (200h-360h)
* irq=##              - specify interrupt level
* mmode=#####         - specify memory base address
* dma=#               - specify dma channel
* media=rj45          - specify media type
   or media=2
   or media=aui
   or medai=auto
* duplex=f            - specify forced half/full/autonegotiate duplex
   or duplex=h
   or duplex=auto
* debug=#             - debug level

NOTES:
* If an EEPROM is present, any specified command-line parameter will override
the corresponding configuration value stored in EEPROM.

* If no "io" or "mmode" parameter is specified on the command-line, the driver
will scan for the adapter.  When scanning, the driver only reads I/O ports.  
This sometimes is not sufficient, (e.g. after a warm boot).  If you wish to 
allow the driver to perform a more aggressive scan (one write to the IO base 
addresses to reset the data port pointer) you can specify an I/O address with 
an address value one greater than the configured address.  Example, to scan for
an adapter located at IO base 0x300, specify an IO address of 0x301.  Only 
ports between 200h and 360h at 20h intervals are scanned.  

* The "duplex=auto" parameter is only supported for the CS8920.

* The minimum command-line configuration required if an EEPROM is not present
is:

  * io or mmode base address
  * irq 
  * media type (no autodetect)

The following additional parameters are CS89XX defaults (values used with no 
EEPROM or command-line argument).

  * DMA Burst = enabled
  * IOCHRDY Enabled = enabled
  * UseSA = enabled
  * CS8900 defaults to half-duplex if not specified on command-line
  * CS8920 defaults to autoneg if not specified on command-line
  * Use reset defaults for other config parameters

* You can use ifconfig to set the adapter's Ethernet address.




4.0 COMPILING THE DRIVER
===============================================================================

The cs89x0 driver can be compiled directly into the kernel or compiled into
a loadable device driver module.

NOTE: This part of the description relates to adding the driver to a kernel
not containing the cs89x0 driver. This kernel already contains it.

4.1 COMPILING THE DRIVER AS A LOADABLE MODULE

To compile the driver into a loadable module, use the following command 
(single command line, without quotes):

"gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -I/usr/src/linux/net/inet -Wall 
-Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -DMODULE -DCONFIG_MODVERSIONS 
-c cs89x0.c"


4.2 COMPILING THE DRIVER INTO THE KERNEL

To compile the driver directly into the kernel requires editing four 
configuration files, copying the source file to the /linux/drivers/net
directory and then running the make utility to rebuild the kernel.

1. Edit the following configuration files by adding the statements as
indicated.  (When possible, try to locate the added text to the section of the
file containing similar statements).

a.) In /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/CONFIG, add

CS89x0_OPTS   =

Example:

 WD_OPTS	= #-DWD_SHMEM=0xDD000
 EL2_OPTS	= #-DEL2_AUI
 CS89x0_OPTS	=                
 NE_OPTS	=
 HP_OPTS	=
 PLIP_OPTS	=


b.) In /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/Config.in, add:

tristate 'CS89x0 support' CONFIG_CS89x0

Example:

     if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" ]; then
       tristate 'ICL EtherTeam 16i/32 support' CONFIG_ETH16I
     fi

     tristate 'CS89x0 support' CONFIG_CS89x0

     tristate 'NE2000/NE1000 support' CONFIG_NE2000
     if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" ]; then
       tristate 'NI5210 support' CONFIG_NI52


c.) In /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/Makefile, add the following lines: 

ifeq ($(CONFIG_CS89x0),y)
L_OBJS += cs89x0.o
else
  ifeq ($(CONFIG_CS89x0),m)
  M_OBJS += cs89x0.o
  endif
endif


d.) In /linux/drivers/net/Space.c file, add the line:

extern int cs89x0_probe(struct device *dev);


Example:

 extern int ultra_probe(struct device *dev);
 extern int wd_probe(struct device *dev);
 extern int el2_probe(struct device *dev);

 extern int cs89x0_probe(struct device *dev);

 extern int ne_probe(struct device *dev);
 extern int hp_probe(struct device *dev);
 extern int hp_plus_probe(struct device *dev);


Also add:

 #ifdef CONFIG_CS89x0
 	&& cs89x0_probe(dev)
 #endif


2.) Copy the driver source files (cs89x0.c and cs89x0.h) and this README file 
into the /usr/src/linux/drivers/net directory.


3.) Run 'make config' followed by 'make dep' and finally 'make' to rebuild 
the kernel. 


4.3 COMPILING THE DRIVER FOR A LINUX v1.2.13 KERNEL

To compile the driver for Linux v1.2.13 (into the kernel or as a module), 
change the "SUPPORTS" define at the beginning of the cs89x0.c file.  
Example:

#define SUPPORTS_1_2_13 1   /* supports Linux kernel v1.2.13 */
   or
#define SUPPORTS_1_2_13 0   /* supports Linux kernel v2.0 (default) */



5.0 TESTING AND TROUBLESHOOTING
===============================================================================

5.1 KNOWN DEFECTS and LIMITATIONS

Refer to the RELEASE.TXT file distributed as part of this archive for a list of 
known defects, driver limitations, and work arounds.


5.2 TESTING THE ADAPTER

Once the adapter has been installed and configured, the diagnostic option of 
the CS8900/20 Setup Utility can be used to test the functionality of the 
adapter and its network connection.  Use the diagnostics 'Self Test' option to
test the functionality of the adapter with the hardware configuration you have
assigned. You can use the diagnostics 'Network Test' to test the ability of the
adapter to communicate across the Ethernet with another PC equipped with a 
CS8900/20-based adapter card (it must also be running the CS8900/20 Setup 
Utility).

         NOTE: The Setup Utility's diagnostics are designed to run in a
         DOS-only operating system environment.  DO NOT run the diagnostics 
         from a DOS or command prompt session under Windows 95, Windows NT, 
         OS/2, or other operating system.

	[AC - Question : Do they work in DOSEMU ?]

To run the diagnostics tests on the CS8900/20 adapter:

   1.) Boot DOS on the PC and start the CS8900/20 Setup Utility.

   2.) The adapter's current configuration is displayed.  Hit the ENTER key to
       get to the main menu.

   4.) Select 'Diagnostics' (ALT-G) from the main menu.  
       * Select 'Self-Test' to test the adapter's basic functionality.
       * Select 'Network Test' to test the network connection and cabling.


5.2.1 DIAGNOSTIC SELF-TEST

The diagnostic self-test checks the adapter's basic functionality as well as 
its ability to communicate across the ISA bus based on the system resources 
assigned during hardware configuration.  The following tests are performed:

   * IO Register Read/Write Test
     The IO Register Read/Write test insures that the CS8900/20 can be 
     accessed in IO mode, and that the IO base address is correct.

   * Shared Memory Test
     The Shared Memory test insures the CS8900/20 can be accessed in memory 
     mode and that the range of memory addresses assigned does not conflict 
     with other devices in the system.

   * Interrupt Test
     The Interrupt test insures there are no conflicts with the assigned IRQ
     signal.

   * EEPROM Test
     The EEPROM test insures the EEPROM can be read.

   * Chip RAM Test
     The Chip RAM test insures the 4K of memory internal to the CS8900/20 is
     working properly.

   * Internal Loop-back Test
     The Internal Loop Back test insures the adapter's transmitter and 
     receiver are operating properly.  If this test fails, make sure the 
     adapter's cable is connected to the network (check for LED activity for 
     example).

   * Boot PROM Test
     The Boot PROM  test insures the Boot PROM is present, and can be read.
     Failure indicates the Boot PROM  was not successfully read due to a
     hardware problem or due to a conflicts on the Boot PROM address
     assignment. (Test only applies if the adapter is configured to use the
     Boot PROM option.)

Failure of a test item indicates a possible system resource conflict with 
another device on the ISA bus.  In this case, you should use the Manual Setup 
option to reconfigure the adapter by selecting a different value for the system
resource that failed.


5.2.2 DIAGNOSTIC NETWORK TEST

The Diagnostic Network Test verifies a working network connection by 
transferring data between two CS8900/20 adapters installed in different PCs 
on the same network. (Note: the diagnostic network test should not be run 
between two nodes across a router.) 

This test requires that each of the two PCs have a CS8900/20-based adapter
installed and have the CS8900/20 Setup Utility running.  The first PC is 
configured as a Responder and the other PC is configured as an Initiator.  
Once the Initiator is started, it sends data frames to the Responder which 
returns the frames to the Initiator.

The total number of frames received and transmitted are displayed on the 
Initiator's display, along with a count of the number of frames received and 
transmitted OK or in error.  The test can be terminated anytime by the user at 
either PC.

To setup the Diagnostic Network Test:

    1.) Select a PC with a CS8900/20-based adapter and a known working network
        connection to act as the Responder.  Run the CS8900/20 Setup Utility 
        and select 'Diagnostics -> Network Test -> Responder' from the main 
        menu.  Hit ENTER to start the Responder.

    2.) Return to the PC with the CS8900/20-based adapter you want to test and
        start the CS8900/20 Setup Utility. 

    3.) From the main menu, Select 'Diagnostic -> Network Test -> Initiator'.
        Hit ENTER to start the test.
 
You may stop the test on the Initiator at any time while allowing the Responder
to continue running.  In this manner, you can move to additional PCs and test 
them by starting the Initiator on another PC without having to stop/start the 
Responder.
 


5.3 USING THE ADAPTER'S LEDs

The 2 and 3-media adapters have two LEDs visible on the back end of the board 
located near the 10Base-T connector.  

Link Integrity LED: A "steady" ON of the green LED indicates a valid 10Base-T 
connection.  (Only applies to 10Base-T.  The green LED has no significance for
a 10Base-2 or AUI connection.)

TX/RX LED: The yellow LED lights briefly each time the adapter transmits or 
receives data. (The yellow LED will appear to "flicker" on a typical network.)


5.4 RESOLVING I/O CONFLICTS

An IO conflict occurs when two or more adapter use the same ISA resource (IO 
address, memory address or IRQ).  You can usually detect an IO conflict in one 
of four ways after installing and or configuring the CS8900/20-based adapter:

    1.) The system does not boot properly (or at all).

    2.) The driver can not communicate with the adapter, reporting an "Adapter
        not found" error message.

    3.) You cannot connect to the network or the driver will not load.

    4.) If you have configured the adapter to run in memory mode but the driver
        reports it is using IO mode when loading, this is an indication of a
        memory address conflict.

If an IO conflict occurs, run the CS8900/20 Setup Utility and perform a 
diagnostic self-test.  Normally, the ISA resource in conflict will fail the 
self-test.  If so, reconfigure the adapter selecting another choice for the 
resource in conflict.  Run the diagnostics again to check for further IO 
conflicts.

In some cases, such as when the PC will not boot, it may be necessary to remove
the adapter and reconfigure it by installing it in another PC to run the 
CS8900/20 Setup Utility.  Once reinstalled in the target system, run the 
diagnostics self-test to ensure the new configuration is free of conflicts 
before loading the driver again.

When manually configuring the adapter, keep in mind the typical ISA system 
resource usage as indicated in the tables below.

I/O Address    	Device                        IRQ      Device
-----------    	--------                      ---      --------
