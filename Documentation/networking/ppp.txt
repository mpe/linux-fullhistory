*NEWSFLASH*
This kernel release needs a minor bug fix for pppd to run properly with
the new routing code.  When your pppd doesn't work apply the following 
patch to pppd-2.2.0f or update to the newest pppd version.

Patch:

--- ppp-2.2.0f/pppd/sys-linux.c-o	Wed Sep 17 00:23:01 1997
+++ ppp-2.2.0f/pppd/sys-linux.c	Wed Sep 17 00:23:11 1997

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The PPP support for this kernel requires the 2.2.0 version of the
pppd daemon. You will find the current version of the daemon on
sunsite.unc.edu in the /pub/Linux/system/Network/serial directory.

Sunsite has many mirror sites. Please feel free to obtain it from
a mirror site close to you.

If you attempt to use a version of pppd which is not compatible
then you will have some error condition. It usually is reflected
in that an ioctl operation will generate a fatal error.

Please do not use earlier versions of the 2.2 package. If you
obtained a copy from merit.edu or bellatrix then please get an
update from the sunsite site.

The CCP (Compression Control Protocol) which is supported by this
code is functional. You will need a compatible BSD compressor on
your peer site to use the code.

The BSD compression code will only build as a loadable module. There
was an earlier version which would build it into the kernel but that
functionality has been removed for various reasons.
