This is the ALPHA version of the ltpc driver.

In order to use it, you will need at least version 1.3.3 of the
netatalk package, and the Apple or Farallon Localtalk PC card.
There are a number of different Localtalk cards for the PC; this
driver applies only to the one with the 65c02 processor chip on it.

To include it in the kernel, select the CONFIG_LTPC switch in the
configuration dialog; at this time (kernel 2.1.23) compiling it as
a module will not work.

Before starting up the netatalk demons (perhaps in rc.local), you
need to add a line such as:

/sbin/ifconfig ltalk0 127.0.0.42


The driver will autoprobe, and you should see a message like:
"LocalTalk card found at 240, IR9, DMA1."
at bootup.

The appropriate netatalk configuration depends on whether you are
attached to a network that includes appletalk routers or not.  If,
like me, you are simply connecting to your home Macintoshes and
printers, you need to set up netatalk to "seed".  The way I do this
is to have the lines

dummy -seed -phase 2 -net 2000 -addr 2000.26 -zone "1033"
ltalk0 -seed -phase 1 -net 1033 -addr 1033.27 -zone "1033"

in my atalkd.conf.  What is going on here is that I need to fool
netatalk into thinking that there are two appletalk interfaces
present -- otherwise it refuses to seed.  This is a hack, and a
more permanent solution would be to alter the netatalk code.
Note that the dummy driver needs to accept multicasts also -- earlier
versions of dummy.c may need to be patched.  


If you are attached to an extended appletalk network, with routers on
it, then you don't need to fool around with this -- the appropriate
line in atalkd.conf is

ltalk0 -phase 1

--------------------------------------

Card Configuration:

The interrupts and so forth are configured via the dipswitch on the
board.  Set the switches so as not to conflict with other hardware.

       Interrupts -- set at most one.  If none are set, the driver uses
       polled mode.  Because the card was developed in the XT era, the
       original documentation refers to IRQ2.  Since you'll be running
       this on an AT (or later) class machine, that really means IRQ9.

       SW1     IRQ 4
       SW2     IRQ 3
       SW3     IRQ 9 (2 in original card documentation only applies to XT)


       DMA -- choose DMA 1 or 3, and set both corresponding switches.

       SW4     DMA 3
       SW5     DMA 1
       SW6     DMA 3
       SW7     DMA 1


       I/O address -- choose one.

       SW8     220 / 240

--------------------------------------

IP:
	Many people are interested in this driver in order to use IP
when Localtalk, but no Ethernet, is available.  While the code to do
this is not strictly speaking part of this driver, an experimental 
version is available which seems to work under kernel 2.0.xx.  It is
not yet functional in the 2.1.xx kernels.

--------------------------------------

BUGS:

2.0.xx:

2.1.xx:	The module support doesn't work yet.
