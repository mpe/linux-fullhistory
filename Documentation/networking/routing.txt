NEWS for user.

- Policy based routing. Routing decisions are made on the base
  not only of destination address, but also source address,
  TOS and incoming interface.
- Complete set of IP level control messages.
  Now Linux is the only in the world OS comlying to RFC requirements.
  Great win 8)
- New interface addressing paradigm.
  Assignment of address ranges to interface,
  multiple prefixes etc. etc.
  Do not bother, it is compatible with old one. Moreover:
- You more need not make "route add aaa.bbb.ccc... eth0",
  it is made automatically.
- "Abstract" UNIX sockets and security enhancements.
  It is necessary to use TIRPC and TLI emulation library.

NEWS for hacker.

- New destination cache. Flexible, robust and just beatiful.
- Network stack is reordered, simplified, optimized, a lot of bugs fixed.
  (well, and new bugs are intoduced, but I've yet not seen them 8))
  It is difficult to descibe all the changes, look into source.

If you see this file, then this patch works 8)
