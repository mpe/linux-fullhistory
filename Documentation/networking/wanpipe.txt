INTRODUCTION

WANPIPE(tm) is a family of intelligent multiprotocol WAN communication adapters
for personal computers (ISA bus) designed to provide PC connectivity to
various communication links, such as leased lines and public data networks, at
speeds up to T1/E1 using a variety of synchronous communications protocols,
including frame relay, PPP, X.25, SDLC, etc.

WANPIPE driver together with Linux WAN Router module allows you to build a
relatively inexpensive, yet high-performance multiprotocol WAN router.  For
more information about the Linux WAN Router please read the file
Documentation/networking/wan-router.txt.  You must also obtain the WAN Tools
package to be able to use the Linux WAN Router and WANPIPE driver.  The package
is available via the Internet from Sangoma Technologies' anonymous FTP server:

	ftp.sangoma.com/pub/linux/wantools-X.Y.Z.tgz
			or
	ftp.sangoma.com/pub/linux/wanpipe-X.Y.Z.tgz

The names of the packages differ only due to naming convention.  The 
functionality of wantools and wanpipe packages are the same.  The latest 
version of the WAN Drivers is wanpipe-2.0.0.
