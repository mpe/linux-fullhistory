To verify that your adapter is supported, find the board ID number on the 
adapter. Look for a label that has a barcode and a number in the format 
A12345-001. Match this to the list of numbers above.

For more information on how to identify your adapter, go to the Adapter & 
Driver ID Guide at:

Command Line Parameters
=======================

If the driver is built as a module, the  following optional parameters are 
used by entering them on the command line with the modprobe or insmod command
using this syntax:

     modprobe e100 [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...]

     insmod e100 [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...] 

For example, with two Intel PRO/100 PCI adapters, entering:
	
     modprobe e100 TxDescriptors=32,128

loads the e100 driver with 32 TX resources for the first adapter and 128 TX 
resources for the second adapter. This configuration favors the second 
adapter. The driver supports up to 16 network adapters concurrently.

The default value for each parameter is generally the recommended setting,
unless otherwise noted.

NOTE: Giving any command line option the value "-1" causes the driver to use 
      the appropriate default value for that option, as if no value was 
      specified.


BundleMax
Valid Range: 1-65535
Default Value: 6
   This parameter holds the maximum number of small packets (less than 128
   bytes) in a bundle. Suggested values range from 2 to 10. See "CPU Cycle 
   Saver."

BundleSmallFr
Valid Range: 0-1 (0=off, 1=on)
Default Value: 0
   The value 1 (on) causes small packets (less than 128 bytes) to be bundled. 
   See "CPU Cycle Saver."

e100_speed_duplex
Valid Range: 0-4 (1=10half;2=10full;3=100half;4=100full)
Default Value: 0
   The default value of 0 sets the adapter to auto-negotiate. Other values
   set the adapter to forced speed and duplex. 
   Example usage: insmod e100.o e100_speed_duplex=4,4 (for two adapters)

flow_control
Valid Range: 0-1 (0=off, 1=on)
Default Value: 0
   This parameter controls the automatic generation(Tx) and response(Rx) to 
   Ethernet PAUSE frames. flow_control should NOT be set to 1 when the 
   adapter is connected to an interface that does not support Ethernet PAUSE 
   frames and when the e100_speed_duplex parameter is NOT set to zero. 

IntDelay
Valid Range: 0-65535 (0=off)
Default Value: 1536
   This parameter holds the number of time units (in adapter terminology)
   until the adapter generates an interrupt. The recommended value for 
   IntDelay is 1536 (upon initialization). Suggested values range from 
   512 to 2048. See "CPU Cycle Saver."

IFS
Valid Range: 0-1 (0=off, 1=on)
Default Value: 1
  Inter Frame Spacing (IFS) aims to reduce the number of Ethernet frame
  collisions by altering the time between frame transmissions. When IFS is 
  enabled the driver tries to find an optimal IFS value. It is used only at 
  half duplex.

RxDescriptors
Valid Range: 8-1024
Default Value: 64
   This parameter defines the number of receive descriptors allocated by 
   the driver. Increasing this value allows the driver to buffer more 
   incoming packets before the driver is required to service an interrupt. 
   The maximum value for Itanium-based systems is 64.

TxDescriptors
Valid Range: 19-1024
Default Value: 64
   This value is the number of transmit descriptors allocated by the driver. 
   Increasing this value allows the protocol stack to queue more transmits at
   the driver level. The maximum value for Itanium-based systems is 64.

ucode
Valid Range: 0-1 (0=off, 1=on)
Default Value: 0 for 82558-based adapters
               1 for 82559, 82550, and 82551-based adapters
   On uploads the micro code to the adapter, which enables CPU Cycle Saver. 
   See the section "CPU Cycle Saver" below.
   Example usage: insmod e100.o ucode=1

   Not available on 82557-based adapters.

XsumRX
Valid Range: 0-1 (0=off, 1=on)
Default Value: 1
   On allows Rx checksum offloading for TCP/UDP packets. Requires that the 
   hardware support this feature.

   Not available on 82557 and 82558-based adapters.


CPU Cycle Saver
================

CPU Cycle Saver reduces CPU utilization by reducing the number of interrupts 
that the adapter generates.

When CPU Cycle Saver is turned off, the adapter generates one interrupt for 
every frame that is received. This means that the operating system stops what
it is doing and switches to the network driver in order to process the 
receive.

When CPU Cycle Saver is on, the adapter does not generate an interrupt for 
every frame it receives. Instead, it waits until it receives several frames 
before generating an interrupt. This reduces the amount of time spent 
switching to and from the driver. 

CPU Cycle Saver consists of these arguments: IntDelay, BundleMax and 
BundleSmallFr. When IntDelay is increased, the adapter waits longer for 
frames to arrive before generating the interrupt. By increasing BundleMax, 
the network adapter waits for the number of small frames (less than 128 bytes)
specified to arrive before generating the interrupt. When BundleSmallFr is 
disabled, the adapter does not bundle small packets. Such small packets are 
often, but not always, control packets that are better served immediately;
therefore, BundleSmallFr is disabled by default.

For most users, it is recommended that CPU Cycle Saver be used with the 
default values specified in the Command Line Parameters section. However, in 
some cases, performance problems may occur with CPU Cycle Saver. If such 
problems are observed, we recommend turning off this feature by setting 
ucode=0.
