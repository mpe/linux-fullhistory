In order to use the ethernet bridging functionality you'll need the
userspace tools available at ftp://openrock.net/bridge. The tarball
available there contains extensive documentation, but if you still have
questions, don't hesitate to post to the mailing list (more info at
http://openrock.net/mailman/listinfo/bridge). You can also mail me at
buytenh@openrock.net.
