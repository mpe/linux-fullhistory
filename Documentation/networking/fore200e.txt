Fore PCA-200E/SBA-200E ATM NIC Firmware Copyright Notice
--------------------------------------------------------

Please read the fore200e_firmware_copyright file present
in the linux/drivers/atm directory for details and restrictions.


Firmware Updates
----------------

The FORE Systems 200E-series driver is shipped with firmware data being 
uploaded to the ATM adapters at system boot time or at module loading time. 
The supplied firmware images should work with all adapters.

However, if you encounter problems (firmware doesn't start or the driver
is unable to read PROM data), you may consider trying another firmware
version. Alternative binary firmware images can be found somewhere on the
ForeThough CD-ROM supplied with your adapter by FORE Systems.

You can also get the latest firmware images from FORE Systems at
http://www.fore.com. Register TACTics Online and go to
the 'software updates' pages. The firmware binaries are part of
the various ForeThough software distributions.

Notice that different versions of the PCA-200E firmware exist, depending
on the endianess of the host architecture. The driver is shipped with
both little and big endian PCA firmware images.

Name and location of the new firmware images can be set at kernel
configuration time.


Driver Rebuilding
-----------------

1. Copy the new firmware binary files (with .bin, .bin1 or .bin2 suffix)
   to some directory, such as linux/drivers/atm.

2. Reconfigure your kernel to set the new firmware name and location.
   Expected pathnames are absolute or relative to the drivers/atm directory.

3. Delete the files drivers/atm/fore200e_pca_fw.[co] and/or fore200e_sba_fw.[co]
   to ensure that the new firmware will be used when rebuilding the kernel or
   the module.

4. Rebuild and re-install your kernel or your module.
