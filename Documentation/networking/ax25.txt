To use the amateur radio protocols within Linux you will need to get a
suitable copy of the AX.25 Utilities. More detailed information about these
and associated programs can be found on http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~jsn/.

For more information about the AX.25, NET/ROM and ROSE protocol stacks, see
the AX25-HOWTO written by Terry Dawson <terry@perf.no.itg.telstra.com.au>
who is also the AX.25 Utilities maintainer.

There is an active mailing list for discussing Linux amateur radio matters
called linux-hams. To subscribe to it, send a message to
Majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with the words "subscribe linux-hams" in the body
of the message, the subject field is ignored.
