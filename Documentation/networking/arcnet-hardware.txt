driver configuration help.

Because so many people (myself included) seem to have obtained ARCnet cards
without manuals, this file contains a quick introduction to ARCnet hardware,
some cabling tips, and a listing of all jumper settings I can find. Please
e-mail apenwarr@foxnet.net with any settings for your particular card, or
any other information you have!


INTRODUCTION TO ARCNET
----------------------

ARCnet is a network type which works in a way similar to popular "ethernet"
networks but which is also different in some very important ways.

First of all, you can get ARCnet cards in two speeds: 2.5Mbps (slower than
ethernet) and 100Mbps (faster than ethernet).  The two hardware types, as
far as I'm aware, are not compatible and so you cannot wire a 100Mbps card
to a 2.5Mbps card, and so on.  From what I hear, my driver does work with
100Mbps cards, but I haven't been able to verify this myself, since I only
have the 2.5Mbps variety.

You also cannot connect an ARCnet card to any kind of ethernet card and
expect it to work.  

There are two "types" of ARCnet - STAR topology and BUS topology.  This
refers to how the cards are meant to be wired together.  According to all
available documentation, you can only connect STAR cards to STAR cards and
BUS cards to BUS cards.  That makes sense, right?  Well, it's not quite
true; see below under "Cabling."

Once you get past these little stumbling blocks, ARCnet is actually quite a
well-designed standard.  It uses something called "modified token passing"
which makes it completely incompatible with so-called "Token Ring" cards,
but which makes transfers much more reliable than with ethernet.  In fact,
ARCnet will guarantee that a packet arrives safely at the destination, and
even if it can't possibly be delivered properly (ie. because of a cable
break) it will at least tell the sender about it.

In addition, all known ARCnet cards have an (almost) identical programming
interface.  This means that with one "arcnet" driver you can support any
card; whereas, with ethernet, each manufacturer uses what is sometimes a
completely different programming interface, leading to a lot of different,
sometimes very similar, ethernet drivers.  Of course, always using the same
programming interface also means that when high-performance hardware
facilities like PCI busmastering DMA appear, it's hard to take advantage of
them.

One thing that makes ARCnet cards difficult to program for, however, is the
limit on their packet sizes; standard ARCnet can only send packets that are
up to 508 bytes in length.  This is smaller than the internet "bare minimum"
of 576 bytes, let alone the ethernet MTU of 1500.  To compensate, an extra
level of encapsulation is defined by RFC1201 called "packet splitting" which
allows "virtual packets" to grow as large as 64K each, although they are
generally kept down to the ethernet-style 1500 bytes.


CABLING ARCNET NETWORKS
-----------------------
 - Information in this section is from several contributors, including:
 	Stephen A. Wood <saw@hallc1.cebaf.gov>
 	John Paul Morrison <jmorriso@bogomips.ee.ubc.ca>
 	Joachim Koenig <jojo@repas.de>
 	Vojtech Pavlik <vpav4328@Diana.troja.mff.cuni.cz>

 - I, Avery Pennarun, tried to arrange it into something that makes sense
   when all put together.  All mistakes, then, are most likely my fault.
   Bug me about them.

Ideally, according to documentation, ARCnet networks should be connected
with 93 Ohm cables with 93 Ohm resistors as terminators.  I use TV cable and
no resistors to connect two STAR cards.  Blah.  Your mileage may vary.

Here's some more specific information about cables, sent in by Joachim
Koenig (slight touchups by me):

	The following cables are valid for ARCnet:
		RG-62  93 Ohm  up to 610 m
		RG-59/U 75 Ohm up to 457 m
		RG-11/U 75 Ohm up to 533 m
		IBM Typ 1 150 Ohm up to 200 m
		IBM Typ 3 100 Ohm up to 100 m
		
So you can see that while 93 Ohms is ideal, you can still go half a
kilometer with 75 Ohm TV cable.

The above applies to all known ARCnet cards.  Specific to STAR cards,
though, Stephen A. Wood has some information:

	When I bought my two cards at a garage sale, they came with little
	box with four BNC connectors on the outside.  The shields of the
	four connectors are all grounded together, and the center conductors
	were connected by the following resistor network.

	              |
	              |
        	      R
	              |
	         ---R-+-R---
	              | 
	              R
	              |
	              |

	Where R is 47 Ohms.  A little math shows that if you terminate three
	of the outputs with 90 ohms (A cable or a terminator), the remaining
	input sees 90 Ohms.  Therefore this box is impedance matched to 90
	Ohm cable.  So this box can be used to connect 2 to 4 nodes
	together.

If you really use your imagination, you can see how the above diagram kind
of looks like a "star."  John Paul Morrison makes a few notes about the
above:

	The "little box with four BNC connectors on the outside" is an
	Arcnet passive hub. They're worth about $5 (just so you don't get
	ripped off).

	I don't have specs at my fingertips. Basically, don't use too many
	passive hubs (or none at all, apparently passive hubs are A Bad
	Thing.  On the other hand, they're a really cheap way to do things.)

	Arcnet active hubs are available; they are analogous to Ethernet
	twisted pair hubs. You can plug either a single station or a passive
	hub into each port on the active hub. If you plug in a passive hub,
	that lets you connect three more stations.
	
According to Vojtech Pavlik, there shouldn't be more than one passive hub
between two "active ends", an active end being an active hub or an ARCnet
card.
	
As for BUS cards, they're even easier (for more than two cards, anyway; you
can't get much simpler than direct-connecting two STAR cards with a TV
cable).  They work just like Thinnet ethernet; it looks like this:

	R------+------+------+------R
	       |      |      |
	       NODE   NODE   NODE

Where R is the terminator as usual, and '+' represents a T connector.

Okay, then, what if you have a combination of BUS cards and STAR cards?  You
probably can't do ANY combination you want, but Vojtech Pavlik explains what
works for him (WARNING: I, Avery, haven't tried anything this weird myself):

	All that I need is to terminate each end with a STAR card. I think I
	can even connect the cards like this:

	STAR------+-----+-----STAR
	         BUS   BUS

	Where "-" stands for coax, "+" for T connector, "STAR" for star-type
	arcnet card and BUS for bus-type arcnet cards. I think there will be
	no terminators necessary.

He also explains (I paraphrase slightly here):

	R-+----------STAR
	 BUS
 
	In this case, I have to terminate the end with the bus card
	using a terminator. ("R" - terminator, "+" - T connector "-" - coax,
	everything other is probably clear)
	
	[...]
 
	And _MAYBE_ you can do even more complicated and insane combinations 
	when just thinking of the STAR card as a BUS one with an inside 
	installed terminator. (STAR cards are NOT bus ones with terminator, 
	but I believe that they electrically act like them). 

And finally, he gives a shortcut for BUS users that are low on supplies:

	When you have really short cables (about four meters in total) and have lack
	of terminators or T's you can leave one of the terminators out .... or put
	it in the middle like this:
 
	BUS-----T-----BUS
        	R
 
	It's ugly, but it works.
	
I don't pretend to understand what's happening there, but then again, I
don't have BUS cards either.



SETTING THE JUMPERS
-------------------

All ARCnet cards should have a total of four or five different settings:

  - the I/O address:  this is the "port" your ARCnet card is on.  Probed
    values, as of v0.14, are only from 0x200 through 0x3F0. (If your card
    has additional ones, which is possible, please tell me.) This should not
    be the same as any other device on your system.  According to a doc I
    got from Novell, MS Windows prefers values of 0x300 or more, eating
    netconnections on my system otherwise.
	- Avery's favourite: 0x300.

  - the IRQ:  on 8-bit cards, it might be 2 (9), 3, 4, 5, or 7.
             on 16-bit cards, it might be 2 (9), 3, 4, 5, 7, or 10-15.  Make
    sure this is different from any other card on your system.  Note that
    IRQ2 is the same as IRQ9, as far as Linux is concerned.
	- Avery's favourite: IRQ2.

  - the memory address:  Unlike most cards, ARCnets use "shared memory" for
    copying buffers around.  Make SURE it doesn't conflict with any other
    used memory in your system!
	A0000		- VGA graphics memory (ok if you don't have VGA)
        B0000		- Monochrome text mode
        C0000		\  One of these is your VGA BIOS - usually C0000.
        E0000		/
        F0000		- System BIOS

    Anything less than 0xA0000 is, well, a BAD idea since it isn't above
    640k.
	- Avery's favourite: 0xD0000

  - the station address:  Every ARCnet card has its own "unique" network
    address from 0 to 255.  Unlike ethernet, you can set this address
    yourself with a jumper.  Since it's only 8 bits, you can only have 254
    ARCnet cards on a network.  DON'T use 0 or 255, since these are
    reserved. (although neat stuff will probably happen if you DO use them). 
    By the way, if you haven't already guessed, don't set this the same as
    any other ARCnet on your network!
	- Avery's favourite:  3 and 4.  Not that it matters.
	
  - There may be ETS1 and ETS2 settings.  These may or may not make a
    difference, but are used to change the delays used when powering up
    a computer on the network.  This is only necessary when wiring VERY
    long range ARCnet networks, on the order of 4km or so; in any case,
    the only real requirement here is that all cards on the network with
    ETS1 and ETS2 jumpers have them in the same position.


Here's the all the jumper information I could obtain for individual card
types.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of duplicated information here. 
Someday, I may get around to actually organizing it.  Until then... too much
is better than too little, I say :)

The model # is listed right above specifics for that card, so you should be
able to use your text viewer's "search" function to find the entry you want. 

If your model isn't listed, and has different settings, PLEASE PLEASE tell
me.  I had to figure mine out without the manual, and it WASN'T FUN!

Even if your ARCnet model isn't listed, but has the same jumpers as another
model that is, please e-mail me to say so.

     About the jumpers: On my PC130 there is one more jumper, located near the
     cable-connector and it's for changing to star or bus topology; 
     closed: star - open: bus
     On the PC500 are some more jumper-pins, one block labled with RX,PDN,TXI
     and another with ALE,LA17,LA18,LA19 these are undocumented..

Setting one of the switches to Off/Open means "1", On/Closed means "0".


Setting the Node ID
-------------------

The eight switches in group S2 are used to set the node ID.
Each node attached to the network must have an unique node ID which
must be diffrent from 0.
Switch 1 serves as the least significant bit (LSB).

The node ID is the sum of the values of all switches set to "1"  
These values are:
    Switch | Value
    -------|-------
      1    |   1
      2    |   2
      3    |   4
      4    |   8
      5    |  16
      6    |  32
      7    |  64
      8    | 128

Some Examples:

    Switch         | Hex     | Decimal 
   8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 | Node ID | Node ID
   ----------------|---------|---------

Setting the I/O Base Address
----------------------------

The first three switches in switch group S1 are used to select one
of eight possible I/O Base addresses using the followig table


   Switch | Hex I/O
   1 2 3  | Address
   -------|--------
   0 0 0  |  260
   0 0 1  |  290

Setting the Base Memory (RAM) buffer Address
--------------------------------------------

The memory buffer requires 2K of a 16K block of RAM. The base of this
16K block can be located in any of eight positions.
Switches 4-6 of switch group S1 select the Base of the 16K block.
Within that 16K address space, the buffer may be assigned any one of four 
positions, determined by the offset, switches 7 and 8 of group S1.

*) To enable the 8K Boot PROM install the jumper ROM.
   The default is jumper ROM not installed.


Setting the Timeouts and Interrupt
----------------------------------

The jumpers labeled EXT1 and EXT2 are used to determine the timeout 
parameters. These two jumpers are normally left open.
Refer to the COM9026 Data Sheet for alternate configurations.

To select a hardware interrupt level set one (only one!) of the jumpers
IRQ2, IRQ3, IRQ4, IRQ5, IRQ7. The Manufactor's default is IRQ2.
 

Configuring the PC130E for Star or Bus Topology
-----------------------------------------------

The single jumper labeled STAR is used to configure the PC130E board for 
star or bus topology.
When the jumper is installed, the board may be used in a star network, when 
it is removed, the board can be used in a bus topology.


Diagnostic LEDs
---------------

Two diagnostic LEDs are visible on the rear bracket of the board.
The green LED monitors the network activity: the red one shows the
board activity:

STANDARD MICROSYSTEMS CORPORATION (SMC) ARCNET-PC500/PC550 Long Board
=====================================================================

Note: There is another Version of the PC500 called Short Version, which 
      is different in hard- and software! The most important differences
      are:
      - The long board has no Shared memory
      - On the long board the selection of the interrupt is done by binary
        coded switch, on the short board directly by jumper.


This description has been written by Juergen Seifert <seifert@htwm.de>

Setting one of the switches to Off/Open means "1", On/Closed means "0".


Setting the Node ID
-------------------

The eight switches in group SW3 are used to set the node ID. Each node
attached to the network must have an unique node ID which must be 
diffrent from 0.
Switch 1 serves as the least significant bit (LSB).

The node ID is the sum of the values of all switches set to "1"  
These values are:

    Switch | Value
    -------|-------
      1    |   1
      2    |   2
      3    |   4
      4    |   8
      5    |  16
      6    |  32
      7    |  64
      8    | 128

Some Examples:

    Switch         | Hex     | Decimal 
   8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 | Node ID | Node ID
   ----------------|---------|---------

   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 |   FF    |  255 


Setting the I/O Base Address
----------------------------

The first six switches in switch group SW1 are used to select one
of 32 possible I/O Base addresses using the followig table

   Switch       | Hex I/O
   6 5  4 3 2 1 | Address
   -------------|--------
   0 1  0 0 0 0 |  200

   1 1  1 1 1 0 |  3E0
   1 1  1 1 1 1 |  3F0


Setting the Interrupt
---------------------

Switches seven through ten of switch group SW1 are used to select the 
interrupt level. The interrupt level is binary coded, so selections 
from 0 to 15 would be possible, but only the following eight values will
be supported: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12.

   Switch   | IRQ
   10 9 8 7 | 
   ---------|-------- 
    0 0 1 1 |  3
    0 1 0 0 |  4
    0 1 0 1 |  5
    0 1 1 1 |  7
    1 0 0 1 |  9 (=2) (default)
    1 0 1 0 | 10
    1 0 1 1 | 11
    1 1 0 0 | 12


Setting the Timeouts 
--------------------

The two jumpers JP2 (1-4) are used to determine the timeout parameters. 
These two jumpers are normally left open.
Refer to the COM9026 Data Sheet for alternate configurations.


Configuring the PC500 for Star or Bus Topology
----------------------------------------------

The single jumper labeled JP6 is used to configure the PC500 board for 
star or bus topology.
When the jumper is installed, the board may be used in a star network, when 
it is removed, the board can be used in a bus topology.


Diagnostic LEDs
---------------

Two diagnostic LEDs are visible on the rear bracket of the board.
The green LED monitors the network activity: the red one shows the
board activity:

 Green  | Status               Red      | Status
 -------|-------------------   ---------|-------------------
  on    | normal activity      flash/on | data transfer

PDI507 (16-bit card)
--------------------
	- from Mark Rejhon <mdrejhon@magi.com> (slight modifications by
	  Avery)
	- Send questions/suggestions/etc about this text to Mark.

Jumpers:

	There is a jumper array at the bottom of the card, near the edge
        connector.  This array is labelled J1.  They control the IRQs and
        something else.  Put only one jumper on the IRQ pins.

	IRQ2    - Use IRQ 2 (same as IRQ 9 as far as software is concerned)
	IRQ3	- Use IRQ 3 (used by COM2 or COM4 serial port if either exists)
	IRQ4	- Use IRQ 4 (used by COM1 or COM3 serial port if either exists)
	IRQ5	- Use IRQ 5 (used by LPT2 parallel port if one exists)
	IRQ6	- Use IRQ 6 (used by Floppy Disk Controller if one exists)
	IRQ7	- Use IRQ 7 (used by LPT1 parallel port if one exists)

[Avery's note:  This "unknown" set of two jumpers appears to be on all
ARCnet cards by SMC as well.  Putting jumpers on them seems to affect the
status register, but only for the two "reserved" bits, ETS1 and ETS2.  Any
further information is welcome.]

	ET1	- What is this?  (Not tested, no jumper put on it)
	ET2	- What is this?  (Not tested, no jumper put on it)

	There is a J2 jumper on two pins.  A jumper should be put on them,
        since it was already there when I got the card.  I don't know what
        this jumper is for though.

	There is a two-jumper array for J3.  I don't know what it is for,
        but there were already two jumpers on it when I got the card.  It's
        a six pin grid in a two-by-three fashion.  The jumpers were
        configured as follows:

	   .-------.
	 o | o   o |
	   :-------:    ------> Accessible end of card with connectors
	 o | o   o |             in this direction ------->
	   `-------'

	There is also a J4 jumper on two pins.  A jumper should be put on
        them, since it was already there when I got the card.  I don't know
        what this jumper is for though.


DIP Switches:

	The dipswitches accessible on the accessible end of the card while
        it is installed, is used to set the arcnet address.  There are 8
        switches.  Use an address from 1 to 254.

	Switch No.
	12345678	Arcnet address
	-----------------------------------------
	00000000	FF  	(Don't use this!)
	00000001	FE
	00000010	FD
	....
	11111101	2	
	11111110	1
	11111111	0	(Don't use this!)

	There is another dipswitch array of 8 switches at the top of the
        card.  There are five labelled MS0-MS4 which seem to control the
        memory address, and another three labelled IO0-IO2 which seem to
        control the base I/O address of the card.

	This was difficult to test by trial and error, and the I/O addresses
        are in a weird order.  This was tested by setting the DIP switches,
        rebooting the computer, and attempting to load ARCETHER at various
        addresses (mostly between 0x200 and 0x400).  The address that caused
        the red transmit LED to blink, is the one that I thought works.

	Also, the address 0x3D0 seem to have a special meaning, since the
        ARCETHER packet driver loaded fine, but without the red LED
        blinking.  I don't know what 0x3D0 is for though.  I recommend using
        an address of 0x300 since Windows may not like addresses below
        0x300.

	IO Switch No.
	210             I/O address
	-------------------------------
	111             0x260
	110             0x290
	101             0x2E0
	100             0x2F0
	011             0x300
	010             0x350
	001             0x380
	000             0x3E0

	The memory switches set a reserved address space of 0x1000 bytes
        (0x100 segment units, or 4k).  For example if I set an address of
        0xD000, it will use up addresses 0xD000 to 0xD100.

	The memory switches were tested by booting using QEMM386 stealth,
        and using LOADHI to see what address automatically became excluded
        from the upper memory regions, and then attempting to load ARCETHER
        using these addresses.

	I recommend using an arcnet memory address of 0xD000, and putting
        the EMS page frame at 0xC000 while using QEMM stealth mode.  That
        way, you get contiguous high memory from 0xD100 almost all the way
        the end of the megabyte.

	Memory Switch 0 (MS0) didn't seem to work properly when set to OFF
        on my card.  It could be malfunctioning on my card.  Experiment with
        it ON first, and if it doesn't work, set it to OFF.  (It may be a
        modifier for the 0x200 bit?)

	MS Switch No.
	43210           Memory address

	00001           0xE100  (guessed - was not detected by QEMM)
	00011           0xE000  (guessed - was not detected by QEMM)

J2      Two 6-position Telephone Jack   (CN120TP/ST/SBT only)

Setting one of the switches to Off means "1", On means "0".


Setting the Node ID
-------------------

The eight switches in SW2 are used to set the node ID. Each node attached
to the network must have an unique node ID which must be diffrent from 0.
Switch 1 (ID0) serves as the least significant bit (LSB).

The node ID is the sum of the values of all switches set to "1"  
These values are:

   Switch | Label | Value
   -------|-------|-------
     1    | ID0   |   1
     2    | ID1   |   2
     3    | ID2   |   4
     4    | ID3   |   8
     5    | ID4   |  16
     6    | ID5   |  32
     7    | ID6   |  64
     8    | ID7   | 128

Some Examples:

    Switch         | Hex     | Decimal 
   8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 | Node ID | Node ID
   ----------------|---------|---------
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 |    not allowed
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 |    1    |    1 
   0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 |    2    |    2
   0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 |    3    |    3

   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 |   FF    |  255


Setting the I/O Base Address
----------------------------

The last three switches in switch block SW1 are used to select one
of eight possible I/O Base addresses using the followig table


   Switch      | Hex I/O
    6   7   8  | Address
   ------------|--------
   ON  ON  ON  |  260
   OFF ON  ON  |  290
   ON  OFF ON  |  2E0  (Manufactor's default)
   OFF OFF ON  |  2F0
   ON  ON  OFF |  300
   OFF ON  OFF |  350
   ON  OFF OFF |  380
   OFF OFF OFF |  3E0


Setting the Base Memory (RAM) buffer Address
--------------------------------------------

The memory buffer (RAM) requires 2K. The base of this buffer can be 
located in any of eight positions. The address of the Boot Prom is
memory base + 8K or memory base + 0x2000.
Switches 1-5 of switch block SW1 select the Memory Base address.

   Switch              | Hex RAM | Hex ROM
    1   2   3   4   5  | Address | Address *)
   --------------------|---------|-----------
   ON  ON  ON  ON  ON  |  C0000  |  C2000
   ON  ON  OFF ON  ON  |  C4000  |  C6000
   ON  ON  ON  OFF ON  |  CC000  |  CE000
   ON  ON  OFF OFF ON  |  D0000  |  D2000  (Manufactor's default)
   ON  ON  ON  ON  OFF |  D4000  |  D6000
   ON  ON  OFF ON  OFF |  D8000  |  DA000
   ON  ON  ON  OFF OFF |  DC000  |  DE000
   ON  ON  OFF OFF OFF |  E0000  |  E2000
  
*) To enable the Boot ROM install the jumper JP1

Note: Since the switches 1 and 2 are always set to ON it may be possible
      that they can be used to add an offset of 2K, 4K or 6K to the base
      address, but this feature is not documented in the manual and I
      haven't testet it yet.


Setting the Interrupt Line
--------------------------

To select a hardware interrupt level install one (only one!) of the jumpers
JP2, JP3, JP4, JP5, JP6. JP2 is the default.

   Jumper | IRQ     
   -------|-----
     2    |  2
     3    |  3
     4    |  4
     5    |  5
     6    |  7


Setting the Internal Terminator on CN120AB/TP/SBT
--------------------------------------------------

The jumper JP12 is used to enable the internal terminator. 

                         -----
       0                |  0  |     
     -----   ON         |     |  ON
    |  0  |             |  0  |
    |     |  OFF         -----   OFF
    |  0  |                0
     -----
   Terminator          Terminator 
    disabled            enabled
  

Selecting the Connector Type on CN120ST/SBT
-------------------------------------------

     JP10    JP11        JP10    JP11
                         -----   -----
       0       0        |  0  | |  0  |       
     -----   -----      |     | |     |
    |  0  | |  0  |     |  0  | |  0  |
    |     | |     |      -----   -----
    |  0  | |  0  |        0       0 
     -----   -----
     Coaxial Cable       Twisted Pair Cable 
       (Default)


Setting the Timeout Parameters
------------------------------

The jumpers labeled EXT1 and EXT2 are used to determine the timeout 
parameters. These two jumpers are normally left open.

Setting one of the switches to Off means "1", On means "0".


Setting the Node ID
-------------------

The eight switches in SW2 are used to set the node ID. Each node attached
to the network must have an unique node ID which must be diffrent from 0.
Switch 1 (ID0) serves as the least significant bit (LSB).

The node ID is the sum of the values of all switches set to "1"  
These values are:

   Switch | Label | Value
   -------|-------|-------
     1    | ID0   |   1
     2    | ID1   |   2
     3    | ID2   |   4
     4    | ID3   |   8
     5    | ID4   |  16
     6    | ID5   |  32
     7    | ID6   |  64
     8    | ID7   | 128

Some Examples:

    Switch         | Hex     | Decimal 
   8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 | Node ID | Node ID
   ----------------|---------|---------
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 |    not allowed

   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 |   FF    |  255


Setting the I/O Base Address
----------------------------

The first six switches in switch block SW1 are used to select the I/O Base
address using the followig table:

             Switch        | Hex I/O
    1   2   3   4   5   6  | Address
   ------------------------|--------
   OFF ON  ON  OFF OFF ON  |  260
   OFF ON  OFF ON  ON  OFF |  290
   OFF ON  OFF OFF OFF ON  |  2E0  (Manufactor's default)
   OFF ON  OFF OFF OFF OFF |  2F0
   OFF OFF ON  ON  ON  ON  |  300
   OFF OFF ON  OFF ON  OFF |  350
   OFF OFF OFF ON  ON  ON  |  380
   OFF OFF OFF OFF OFF ON  |  3E0

Note: Other IO-Base addresses seem to be selectable, but only the above
      combinations are documented.


Setting the Base Memory (RAM) buffer Address
--------------------------------------------

The switches 7-10 of switch block SW1 are used to select the Memory
Base address of the RAM (2K) and the PROM.

   Switch          | Hex RAM | Hex ROM
    7   8   9  10  | Address | Address
   ----------------|---------|-----------
   OFF OFF ON  ON  |  C0000  |  C8000
   OFF OFF ON  OFF |  D0000  |  D8000 (Default)
   OFF OFF OFF ON  |  E0000  |  E8000

Note: Other MEM-Base addresses seem to be selectable, but only the above
      combinations are documented.


Setting the Interrupt Line
--------------------------

To select a hardware interrupt level install one (only one!) of the jumpers
JP3 through JP13 using the following table:

   Jumper | IRQ     
   -------|-----------------
     3    |  14
     4    |  15
     5    |  12
     6    |  11
     7    |  10
     8    |   3
     9    |   4
    10    |   5
    11    |   6
    12    |   7
    13    |   2 (=9) Default!

Note:  - Do not use JP11=IRQ6, it may conflict with your Floppy Disk
         Controler
       - Use JP3=IRQ14 only, if you don't have an IDE-, MFM-, or RLL-
         Hard Disk, it may conflict with their controlers


Setting the Timeout Parameters
------------------------------

The jumpers labeled JP1 and JP2 are used to determine the timeout
parameters. These two jumpers are normally left open.

NONAME 8-BIT ARCNET
===================

I have named this ARCnet card "NONAME", since there is no name of any
manufactor on the Installation manual nor on the shipping box. The only
hint to the existence of a manufactor at all is written into cupper,
it is "Made in Taiwan"

Setting one of the switches to Off means "1", On means "0".


Setting the Node ID
-------------------

The eight switches in group SW1 are used to set the node ID.
Each node attached to the network must have an unique node ID which
must be diffrent from 0.
Switch 8 serves as the least significant bit (LSB).

The node ID is the sum of the values of all switches set to "1"  
These values are:

    Switch | Value
    -------|-------
      8    |   1
      7    |   2
      6    |   4

      3    |  32
      2    |  64
      1    | 128

Some Examples:

    Switch         | Hex     | Decimal 
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 | Node ID | Node ID
   ----------------|---------|---------

   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 |   FF    |  255


Setting the I/O Base Address
----------------------------

The first three switches in switch group SW2 are used to select one
of eight possible I/O Base addresses using the followig table

   Switch      | Hex I/O
    1   2   3  | Address
   ------------|--------
   ON  ON  ON  |  260
   ON  ON  OFF |  290
   ON  OFF ON  |  2E0  (Manufactor's default)
   ON  OFF OFF |  2F0
   OFF ON  ON  |  300
   OFF ON  OFF |  350
   OFF OFF ON  |  380
   OFF OFF OFF |  3E0


Setting the Base Memory (RAM) buffer Address
--------------------------------------------

The memory buffer requires 2K of a 16K block of RAM. The base of this
16K block can be located in any of eight positions.
Switches 4-6 of switch group SW2 select the Base of the 16K block.
Within that 16K address space, the buffer may be assigned any one of four
positions, determined by the offset, switches 7 and 8 of group SW2.

   Switch     | Hex RAM | Hex ROM
   4 5 6  7 8 | Address | Address *)
   -----------|---------|-----------
   0 0 0  0 0 |  C0000  |  C2000

   1 1 1  1 1 |  E1800  |  E2000
  
*) To enable the 8K Boot PROM install the jumper ROM.
   The default is jumper ROM not installed.


Setting Interrupt Request Lines (IRQ)
-------------------------------------

To select a hardware interrupt level set one (only one!) of the jumpers
IRQ2, IRQ3, IRQ4, IRQ5 or IRQ7. The Manufactor's default is IRQ2.
 

Setting the Timeouts
--------------------

The two jumpers labeled ET1 and ET2 are used to determine the timeout
parameters (respons and reconfiguration time). Every node in a network
must be set to the same timeout values.

   ET1 ET2 | Response Time (us) | Reconfiguration Time (ms)
   --------|--------------------|--------------------------
   Off Off |        78          |          840   (Default)
   Off On  |       285          |         1680
   On  Off |       563          |         1680
   On  On  |      1130          |         1680

On means jumper installed, Off means jumper not installed


NONAME 16-BIT ARCNET
====================

The manual of my 8-Bit NONAME ARCnet Card contains another description
of a 16-Bit Coax / Twisted Pair Card. This description is incomplete,
because there are missing two pages in the manual booklet. (The table
of contents reports pages ... 2-9, 2-11, 2-12, 3-1, ... but inside
the booklet there is a diffrent way of counting ... 2-9, 2-10, A-1,
(empty page), 3-1, ..., 3-18, A-1 (again), A-2)
Also the picture of the board layout is not as good as the picture of
8-Bit card, because there isn't any letter like "SW1" written to the
picture.
Should somebody have such a board, please feel free to complete this
description or to send a mail to me!

Setting the Node ID
-------------------

The eight switches in group SW2 are used to set the node ID.
Each node attached to the network must have an unique node ID which
must be diffrent from 0.
Switch 8 serves as the least significant bit (LSB).

The node ID is the sum of the values of all switches set to "1"  
These values are:

    Switch | Value
    -------|-------
      8    |   1
      7    |   2
      6    |   4
      5    |   8
      4    |  16
      3    |  32
      2    |  64
      1    | 128

Some Examples:

    Switch         | Hex     | Decimal 
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 | Node ID | Node ID
   ----------------|---------|---------
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 |    not allowed
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 |    1    |    1 
   0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 |    2    |    2
   0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 |    3    |    3
       . . .       |         |
   0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 |   55    |   85
       . . .       |         |
   1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 |   AA    |  170
       . . .       |         |  
   1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 |   FD    |  253
   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 |   FE    |  254
   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 |   FF    |  255


Setting the I/O Base Address
----------------------------

The first three switches in switch group SW1 are used to select one
of eight possible I/O Base addresses using the followig table

   Switch      | Hex I/O
    3   2   1  | Address
   ------------|--------
   ON  ON  ON  |  260
   ON  ON  OFF |  290
   ON  OFF ON  |  2E0  (Manufactor's default)
   ON  OFF OFF |  2F0
   OFF ON  ON  |  300
   OFF ON  OFF |  350
   OFF OFF ON  |  380
   OFF OFF OFF |  3E0


Setting the Base Memory (RAM) buffer Address
--------------------------------------------

The memory buffer requires 2K of a 16K block of RAM. The base of this
16K block can be located in any of eight positions.
Switches 6-8 of switch group SW1 select the Base of the 16K block.
Within that 16K address space, the buffer may be assigned any one of four
positions, determined by the offset, switches 4 and 5 of group SW1.

   Switch     | Hex RAM | Hex ROM
   8 7 6  5 4 | Address | Address
   -----------|---------|-----------
   0 0 0  0 0 |  C0000  |  C2000

 - from Vojtech Pavlik <vpav4328@diana.troja.mff.cuni.cz>

I have named this ARCnet card "NONAME", since I got only the card with
no manual at all and the only text identifying the manufacturer is 
"MADE IN TAIWAN R.O.C" printed on the card.

This description was written by Vojtech Pavlik 
(vpav4328@diana.troja.mff.cuni.cz) using parts of the ARCNET-jumpers 
README file from Linux kernel 1.2.2.

Legend:

90C65       ARCNET Chip 
SW1 1-5:    Base Memory Address Select
    6-8:    Base I/O Address Select
SW2 1-8:    Node ID Select (ID0-ID7)
SW3 1-5:    IRQ Select   
    6-7:    Extra Timeout
    8  :    Rom Enable   
JP1         Led connector
BNC         Coax connector

Although the jumpers SW1 and SW3 are marked SW, not JP, they are jumpers, not 
switches.

Setting the jumpers to ON means connecting the upper two pins, off the bottom 
two - or - in case of IRQ setting, connecting none of them at all.

Setting the Node ID
-------------------

The eight switches in SW2 are used to set the node ID. Each node attached
to the network must have an unique node ID which must be diffrent from 0.
Switch 1 (ID0) serves as the least significant bit (LSB).

Setting one of the switches to Off means "1", On means "0".

The node ID is the sum of the values of all switches set to "1"  
These values are:

   Switch | Label | Value
   -------|-------|-------
     1    | ID0   |   1
     2    | ID1   |   2
     3    | ID2   |   4
     4    | ID3   |   8
     5    | ID4   |  16
     6    | ID5   |  32
     7    | ID6   |  64
     8    | ID7   | 128

Some Examples:

    Switch         | Hex     | Decimal 
   8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 | Node ID | Node ID
   ----------------|---------|---------
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 |    not allowed
   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 |    1    |    1 
   0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 |    2    |    2
   0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 |    3    |    3
       . . .       |         |
   0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 |   55    |   85
       . . .       |         |
   1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 |   AA    |  170
       . . .       |         |

   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 |   FF    |  255


Setting the I/O Base Address
----------------------------

The last three switches in switch block SW1 are used to select one
of eight possible I/O Base addresses using the followig table


   Switch      | Hex I/O
    6   7   8  | Address
   ------------|--------
   ON  ON  ON  |  260
   OFF ON  ON  |  290
   ON  OFF ON  |  2E0  (Manufactor's default)
   OFF OFF ON  |  2F0
   ON  ON  OFF |  300
   OFF ON  OFF |  350
   ON  OFF OFF |  380
   OFF OFF OFF |  3E0


Setting the Base Memory (RAM) buffer Address
--------------------------------------------

The memory buffer (RAM) requires 2K. The base of this buffer can be 
located in any of eight positions. The address of the Boot Prom is
memory base + 0x2000.
Jumpers 3-5 of jumper block SW1 select the Memory Base address.

   Switch              | Hex RAM | Hex ROM
    1   2   3   4   5  | Address | Address *)
   --------------------|---------|-----------
   ON  ON  ON  ON  ON  |  C0000  |  C2000
   ON  ON  OFF ON  ON  |  C4000  |  C6000
   ON  ON  ON  OFF ON  |  CC000  |  CE000
   ON  ON  OFF OFF ON  |  D0000  |  D2000  (Manufactor's default)
   ON  ON  ON  ON  OFF |  D4000  |  D6000
   ON  ON  OFF ON  OFF |  D8000  |  DA000
   ON  ON  ON  OFF OFF |  DC000  |  DE000
   ON  ON  OFF OFF OFF |  E0000  |  E2000
  
*) To enable the Boot ROM set the jumper 8 of jumper block SW3 to position ON.

The jumpers 1 and 2 probably add 0x0800, 0x1000 and 0x1800 to RAM addres.

Setting the Interrupt Line
--------------------------

Jumpers 1-5 of the jumper block SW3 controll the IRQ level.

    Jumper              |  IRQ
    1   2   3   4   5   |
   ----------------------------
    ON  OFF OFF OFF OFF |  2
    OFF ON  OFF OFF OFF |  3
    OFF OFF ON  OFF OFF |  4
    OFF OFF OFF ON  OFF |  5
    OFF OFF OFF OFF ON  |  7


Setting the Timeout Parameters
------------------------------

The jumpers 6-7 of the jumper block SW3 are used to determine the timeout 
parameters. These two jumpers are normally left in the OFF position.
