/proc/sys/net/ipv4/* Variables:

ip_forward - BOOLEAN
	0 - disabled (default)
	not 0 - enabled 

	Forward Packets between interfaces.

	This variable is special, its change resets all configuration
	parameters to their default state (RFC1122 for hosts, RFC1812
	for routers)

ip_default_ttl - INTEGER
	default 64

ip_no_pmtu_disc - BOOLEAN
	Disable Path MTU Discovery.
	default FALSE

IP Fragmentation:

ipfrag_high_thresh - INTEGER
	Maximum memory used to reassemble IP fragments. When 
	ipfrag_high_thresh bytes of memory is allocated for this purpose,
	the fragment handler will toss packets until ipfrag_low_thresh
	is reached.
	
ipfrag_low_thresh - INTEGER
	See ipfrag_high_thresh	

ipfrag_time - INTEGER
	Time in seconds to keep an IP fragment in memory.	

INET peer storage:

inet_peer_threshold - INTEGER
	The approximate size of the storage.  Starting from this threshold	
	entries will be thrown aggressively.  This threshold also determines
	entries' time-to-live and time intervals between garbage collection
	passes.  More entries, less time-to-live, less GC interval.

inet_peer_minttl - INTEGER
	Minimum time-to-live of entries.  Should be enough to cover fragment
	time-to-live on the reassembling side.  This minimum time-to-live  is
	guaranteed if the pool size is less than inet_peer_threshold.
	Measured in jiffies.

inet_peer_maxttl - INTEGER
	Maximum time-to-live of entries.  Unused entries will expire after
	this period of time if there is no memory pressure on the pool (i.e.
	when the number of entries in the pool is very small).
	Measured in jiffies.

inet_peer_gc_mintime - INTEGER
	Minimum interval between garbage collection passes.  This interval is
	in effect under high memory pressure on the pool.
	Measured in jiffies.

inet_peer_gc_maxtime - INTEGER
	Minimum interval between garbage collection passes.  This interval is
	in effect under low (or absent) memory pressure on the pool.
	Measured in jiffies.

TCP variables: 

tcp_syn_retries - INTEGER
	Number of times initial SYNs for an TCP connection attempt will
	be retransmitted. Should not be higher than 255.

tcp_keepalive_time - INTEGER
	How often TCP sends out keepalive messages when keepalive is enabled.
	Default: 2hours.

tcp_keepalive_probes - INTEGER
	How many keepalive probes TCP sends out, until it decides that the
	connection is broken.

tcp_retries1 - INTEGER
tcp_retries2 - INTEGER
tcp_max_delay_acks - INTEGER
tcp_fin_timeout - INTEGER
tcp_max_ka_probes - INTEGER
tcp_hoe_retransmits - INTEGER
	Undocumented for now.

tcp_syncookies - BOOLEAN
	Only valid when the kernel was compiled with CONFIG_SYNCOOKIES
	Send out syncookies when the syn backlog queue of a socket 
	overflows. This is to prevent against the common 'syn flood attack'
	Default: FALSE

tcp_stdurg - BOOLEAN
	Use the Host requirements interpretation of the TCP urg pointer field.
	Most hosts use the older BSD interpretation, so if you turn this on
	Linux might not communicate correctly with them.	
	Default: FALSE 
	
tcp_syn_taildrop  - BOOLEAN
tcp_max_syn_backlog - INTEGER
	Undocumented (work in progress)

tcp_window_scaling - BOOLEAN
	Enable window scaling as defined in RFC1323.

tcp_timestamps - BOOLEAN
	Enable timestamps as defined in RFC1323.

tcp_sack - BOOLEAN
	Enable select acknowledgments.

tcp_retrans_collapse - BOOLEAN
	Bug-to-bug compatibility with some broken printers.
	On retransmit try to send bigger packets to work around bugs in
	certain TCP stacks.

ip_local_port_range - 2 INTEGERS
	Defines the local port range that is used by TCP and UDP to
	choose the local port. The first number is the first, the 
	second the last local port number. For high-usage systems
	change this to 32768-61000.

icmp_echo_ignore_all - BOOLEAN
icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts - BOOLEAN
	If either is set to true, then the kernel will ignore either all
	ICMP ECHO requests sent to it or just those to broadcast/multicast
	addresses, respectively.

icmp_destunreach_rate - INTEGER
icmp_paramprob_rate - INTEGER
icmp_timeexceed_rate - INTEGER
icmp_echoreply_rate - INTEGER (not enabled per default)
	Limit the maximal rates for sending ICMP packets to specific targets.
	0 to disable any limiting, otherwise the maximal rate in jiffies(1)
	See the source for more information.

icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses - BOOLEAN
	Some routers violate RFC 1122 by sending bogus responses to broadcast
	frames.  Such violations are normally logged via a kernel warning.
	If this is set to TRUE, the kernel will not give such warnings, which
	will avoid log file clutter.
	Default: FALSE

(1) Jiffie: internal timeunit for the kernel. On the i386 1/100s, on the
Alpha 1/1024s. See the HZ define in /usr/include/asm/param.h for the exact
value on your system. 

conf/interface/*: 
conf/all/* is special and changes the settings for all interfaces.
	Change special settings per interface.

log_martians - BOOLEAN
	Log packets with impossible addresses to kernel log.

accept_redirects - BOOLEAN
	Accept ICMP redirect messages.
	default TRUE (host)
		FALSE (router)

forwarding - BOOLEAN
	Enable IP forwarding on this interface.

mc_forwarding - BOOLEAN
	Do multicast routing. The kernel needs to be compiled with CONFIG_MROUTE
	and a multicast routing daemon is required.

proxy_arp - BOOLEAN
	Do proxy arp.

shared_media - BOOLEAN
	Send(router) or accept(host) RFC1620 shared media redirects.
	Overrides ip_secure_redirects.
	default TRUE

secure_redirects - BOOLEAN
	Accept ICMP redirect messages only for gateways,
	listed in default gateway list.
	default TRUE

send_redirects - BOOLEAN
	Send redirects, if router. Default: TRUE

bootp_relay - BOOLEAN
	Accept packets with source address 0.b.c.d destined
	not to this host as local ones. It is supposed, that
	BOOTP relay daemon will catch and forward such packets.

	default FALSE
	Not Implemented Yet.

accept_source_route - BOOLEAN
	Accept packets with SRR option.
	default TRUE (router)
		FALSE (host)

rp_filter - BOOLEAN
	1 - do source validation by reversed path, as specified in RFC1812
	    Recommended option for single homed hosts and stub network
	    routers. Could cause troubles for complicated (not loop free)
	    networks running a slow unreliable protocol (sort of RIP),
	    or using static routes.

	0 - No source validation. 

	Default value is 0. Note that some distribution enable it
	in startip scripts.
