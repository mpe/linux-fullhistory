1. At present the driver autoprobes for a WaveLAN card only at I/O address 
   0x390. The version of the card that I use (NCR) supports four I/O addresses
   (selectable via a pair of DIP switches).  If you want the driver to
   autoprobe a different subset of the four valid addresses then you will need
   to edit .../drivers/net/wavelan.c (near line 714) and change the 
   initialisation of the `iobase[]' array.  Normally, I use a LILO 
   configuration file directive to obviate the need for autoprobing entirely, 
   a course of action I heartily recommend.

2. By default, the driver uses the Network ID (NWID) stored in the card's 
   Parameter Storage Area (PSA).  However, the PSA NWID can be overridden by a
   value passed explicitly as the third numeric argument to LILO's "ether="
   directive, either  at the LILO prompt at boot time or within LILO's 
   configuration file.
   For example, the following line from such a LILO configuration file would
   auto-configure the IRQ value, set the I/O base to 0x390 and set the NWID to
   0x4321, all on a WaveLAN card labelled "eth0":

	..
	append	="ether=0,0x390,0x4321,eth0"
	..

3. The driver uses the IRQ stored in the card's PSA.
   To change this you will need to use the configuration/setup software that
   accompanies each WaveLAN device.  Yes, the driver should use the value passed
   in via LILO and it will, just as soon as I can work out why that part of the
   code doesn't work :-(.

4. If you encounter any problems send me some email.

Good luck,
