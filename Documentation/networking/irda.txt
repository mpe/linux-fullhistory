To use the IrDA protocols within Linux you will need to get a suitable copy
of the IrDA Utilities. More detailed information about these and associated
programs can be found on http://www.cs.uit.no/~dagb/irda/.

For more information about the IrDA protocol stack, see the IR-HOWTO
written by Werner Heuser <r2d2c3po@zedat.fu-berlin.de>

There is an active mailing list for discussing Linux IrDA matters called
linux-irda. To subscribe to it, send a message to Majordomo@list.uit.no
with the words "subscribe linux-irda" in the body of the message, the
subject field is ignored.
