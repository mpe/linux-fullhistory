To use the IrDA protocols within Linux you will need to get a suitable copy
of the IrDA Utilities. More detailed information about these and associated
programs can be found on http://www.cs.uit.no/linux-irda/

For more information about how to use the IrDA protocol stack, see the
IR-HOWTO (http://www.snafu.de/~wehe/IR-HOWTO.html) written by Werner Heuser

There is an active mailing list for discussing Linux-IrDA matters called
linux-irda. To subscribe to it, visit:
