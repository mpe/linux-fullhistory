Linux can read, but not write, OS/2 HPFS partitions.

Mount options are the same as for msdos partitions.

  uid=nnn	All files in the partition will be owned by user id nnn.
  gid=nnn	All files in the partition will be in group nnn.
  umask=nnn	The permission mask (see umask(1)) for the partition.
  conv=binary   Data is returned exactly as is, with CRLFs.  [default]
  conv=text     (Carriage return, line feed) is replaced with newline.
  conv=auto     Chooses, file by file, conv=binary or conv=text (by guessing)

There are mount options unique to HPFS.

  case=lower	Convert file names to lower case.  [default]
  case=asis     Return file names as is, in mixed case.

  nocheck	Proceed even if "Improperly stopped flag is set"

Case is not significant in filename matching, like real HPFS.


Command line example
    mkdir -p /os2/c
    mount -t hpfs -o uid=100,gid=100 /dev/sda6 /os2/c

/etc/fstab example
    /dev/sdb5	/d/f    hpfs    ro,uid=402,gid=402,umask=002
