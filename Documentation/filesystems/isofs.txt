Mount options that are the same as vfat partitions. These are only useful

  iocharset=name Character set to use for converting from Unicode to
		ASCII.  Joliet filenames are stored in Unicode format, but
		Unix for the most part doesn't know how to deal with Unicode.
		There is also an option of doing UTF8 translations with the
		utf8 option.
  utf8          Encode Unicode names in UTF8 format. Default is no.
