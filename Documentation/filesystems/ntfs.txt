NTFS Overview
=============

To mount an NTFS volume, use the filesystem type 'ntfs'. The driver
currently works only in read-only mode, with no fault-tolerance supported.

If you enable the dangerous(!) write support, make sure you can recover
from a complete loss of data. Also, download the Linux-NTFS project
distribution from Sourceforge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-ntfs/
and always run the included ntfsfix utility after performing a write to an
NTFS partition from Linux to fix some of the damage done by the Linux NTFS
driver. You should run ntfsfix _after_ unmounting the partition in Linux but
_before_ rebooting into Windows. During the next reboot into Windows, chkdsk
will be run automatically to fix the remaining damage.

For ftdisk support, limited success was reported with volume sets on top of
the md driver, although mirror and stripe sets should work as well - if the
md driver can be talked into using the same layout as Windows NT. However,
using the md driver will fail if any of your NTFS partitions have an odd
number of sectors.

Please note that the experimental write support is limited to
Windows NT4 and earlier versions at the moment.

The ntfs driver supports the following mount options:
iocharset=name      Character set to use when returning file names.
                    Unlike VFAT, NTFS suppresses names that contain
		    unconvertible characters
utf8=<bool>	    Use UTF-8 for converting file names
uni_xlate=<bool>,2  Use the VFAT-style encoding for file names outside
		    the current character set. A boolean value will
		    enable the feature, a value of 2 will enable the
		    encoding as documented in vfat.txt:
		    ':', (u & 0x3f), ((u>>6) & 0x3f), (u>>12),
uid=
gid=
umask=              These options work as documented in mount(8).
		    By default, the files are owned by root and
		    not readable by somebody else.
posix=<bool>	    If enabled, the file system distinguishes between
		    upper and lower case. The 8.3 alias names are presented
		    as hard links instead of being suppressed.
