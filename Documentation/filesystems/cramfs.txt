	Cramfs - cram a filesystem onto a small ROM

cramfs is designed to be simple and small, and to compress things well. 

It uses the zlib routines to compress a file one page at a time, and
allows random page access.  The meta-data is not compressed, but is
expressed in a very terse representation to make it use much less
diskspace than traditional filesystems. 

You can't write to a cramfs filesystem (making it compressible and
compact also makes it _very_ hard to update on-the-fly), so you have to
create the disk image with the "mkcramfs" utility in scripts/cramfs.
