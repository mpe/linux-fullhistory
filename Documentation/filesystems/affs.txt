Linux can read, but not write, Amiga FFS partitions.

Mount options are
    size	has the size in 512 byte blocks of the mounted medium. 

Case is significant in filename matching, different to real AFFS.


Command line example
    mount  Archive/Amiga/Workbench3.1.adf /mnt -t affs -o loop,size=1760
    mount  /dev/sda3 /Amiga -t affs

/etc/fstab example
    /dev/sdb5	/d/f    affs    ro

This file system will probably be writeable in future releases.

It's not possible to read floppy disks with a normal PC or workstation
due to an incompatibility to the Amiga floppy controller.
