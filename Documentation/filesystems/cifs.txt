This module, cifs, is a filesystem that implements the SMB/CIFS
protocol, which is the protocol used by Windows based operating systems
(including Windows 2000 and its successors) as well as Samba, OS/2 and
many others operating systems and network file server appliances. The
Cifs VFS filesystem module is designed to work well with servers that
implement the newer versions (dialects) of the SMB/CIFS protocol such as
Samba, the program written by Andrew Tridgell that turns any Unix host
into a file server for DOS or Windows clients, as well as Windows NT,
Windows 2000 and its successors. It is not designed to handle older smb
servers well, those that implement older versions of the dialect (such
as OS/2 or Windows 95), for this purpose use smbfs.

This module can support mounting without a mount helper program. The
mount syntax is:
  mount //server_ip/share_name /mnt -o user=username,password=your_password

where "username", "your_password" and "server_ip" and "share_name"
should be replaced with specific values (supplied by the user) e.g.
  mount //9.53.216.16/public /mnt -o user=jsmith,password=openup

This cifs implementation is designed to handle network caching (safely)
as well as to implement locking, large file (64 bit access), distributed
file system ("dfs") and other advanced protocol features. It also
implements the SNIA standard for Unix extensions to CIFS (when
communicating with servers such as Samba 2.2.3 or later which support it).
