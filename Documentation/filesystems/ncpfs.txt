ncpfs is a filesystem which understands the NCP protocol, designed by the
Novell Corporation for their NetWare(tm) product. NCP is functionally
similar to the NFS used in the tcp/ip community.
To mount a Netware-Filesystem, you need a special mount program, which can
be found in ncpfs package. Homesite for ncpfs is linux01.gwdg.de/pub/ncpfs,
but sunsite and its many mirrors will have it as well.

Related products are linware and mars_nwe, which will give Linux partial
Netware Server functionality.
Linware's home site is: klokan.sh.cvut.cz/pub/linux/linware,
Mars_nwe can be found on linux01.gwdg.de/pub/ncpfs.
