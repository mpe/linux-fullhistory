Smbfs is a filesystem that implements the SMB protocol, which is the
protocol used by Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95 and Windows NT.
Smbfs was inspired by samba, the program written by Andrew Tridgell
that turns any unix host into a file server for DOS or Windows clients.
See ftp://nimbus.anu.edu.au/pub/tridge/samba/ for this interesting
program suite and much more information on SMB, NetBIOS over TCP/IP,
and explanations for concepts like netbios name or share.

To use smbfs, you need to install the Samba package (Samba-1.9.17p1 or
later), and you need the special mount program from the smbfs package
(smbfs-2.1.0 or later), found on

	ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/smbfs/dontuse

After downloading the smbfs package, apply the patch to the smbclient
program and recompile.  Smbfs can then be mounted from the smbclient
command line, as for example:

	smb: \>mount /mnt/tmp -f 755

For convenience, you may wish to package the command in a script like this:

#!/bin/sh
echo "mount /mnt/tmp -f 755" | smbclient //server/c$ -U administrator%

Mount-Time Options
Windows 95 has several bugs that affect SMB operations, and smbfs includes
work-arounds for all of the bugs found (so far, at least.) These can be
enabled at compile-time with the CONFIG_SMB_WIN95 kernel option.

Unfortunately, some of the Win 95 work-arounds interact with Win NT bugs,
so if you're using several different types of servers on your network you
probably want to enable the work-arounds at mount time. To do this, answer
`N' to the CONFIG_SMB_WIN95 option, and add the needed options listed below
to the file mode argument of the mount command for the Win 95 servers.

Option                  Value  Effect
Identify Win 95 Server    1    Enables bug fixes
Use Core Attributes       2    Speeds up directory scans, only mtime

To apply the options, sum the values and prepend it to the file mode. For
example, to use both options with file mode 755, you would prepend 3 to 755:

	cnt>mount /mnt/tmp -f 3755

Smbfs will print a message at mount time confirming the selected options.
Note that _only_ Windows 95 servers require special treatment; using the
"core attributes" option with Win NT will give trash timestamp values.

To summarize, if your network includes both Win 95 and NT servers:
(1) Do _not_ enable the CONFIG_SMB_WIN95 kernel option

(2) Add the desired work-around options to the mount command for your
    Win 95 server(s).
