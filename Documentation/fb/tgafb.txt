What is tgafb?
===============

This is a driver for DECChip 21030 based graphics framebuffers, a.k.a. TGA
cards, specifically the following models

ZLxP-E1 (8bpp, 4 MB VRAM)
ZLxP-E2 (32bpp, 8 MB VRAM)
ZLxP-E3 (32bpp, 16 MB VRAM, Zbuffer)

This version, tgafb-1.12, is almost a complete rewrite of the code written
by Geert Uytterhoeven, which was based on the original TGA console code
written by Jay Estabrook.

Major new features:

 * Support for multiple resolutions, including setting the resolution at
   boot time, allowing the use of a fixed-frequency monitor.
 * Complete code rewrite to follow Geert's skeletonfb spec which will allow
   future implementation of hardware acceleration and other features.


Configuration
=============

You can pass kernel command line options to tgafb with
`video=tga:option1,option2:value2,option3' (multiple options should be
separated by comma, values are separated from options by `:').
Accepted options:

font:X    - default font to use. All fonts are supported, including the
            SUN12x22 font which is very nice at high resolutions.
mode:X    - default video mode. See drivers/video/tgafb.c for a list.

XF68_FBDev should work just fine, but I haven't tested it.  Running
the XF86_TGA server (reasonably recent versions of which support all TGA
cards) works fine for me.

One minor problem with XF86_TGA is when running tgafb in resolutions higher
than 640x480, on switching VCs from tgafb to X, the entire screen is not
re-drawn and must be manually refreshed. This is an X server problem, not a
tgafb problem.

Enjoy!
