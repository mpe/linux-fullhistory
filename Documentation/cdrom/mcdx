This actually is an `improved' driver for the Mitsumi CD-ROM drives. 

We are using the major device number 20 for it. So, you have to do

~# mknod /dev/mcdx0 b 20 0
~# mknod /dev/mcdx1 b 20 1

and so on, one entry for each drive to support, once.

If you are using the driver as a module, you can specify the ports and IRQs
like:

 # insmod mcdx.o mcdx=0x300,11

and so on ("address,IRQ" pairs). When You intend to use more then one
drive, it's necessary to edit the mcdx.h file found in
/usr/src/linux/include/linux. Instead of providing the values on the
command line, You can "hardwire" them all in mcdx.h. The command line
values take precedence over the values in mcdx.h. 

WARNING: BE CAREFUL TO SUPPLY THE CORRECT VALUES OTHERWISE THE WHOLE SYSTEM
WILL HANG DURING BOOT-UP OR LOADING OF THE DRIVER!!!

This driver:

	o	Handles XA and multi session CDs as well as ordinary CDs.
	o	Supports up to 5 drives (of course, you'll need free 
		IRQs, i/o ports and slots).
	o	Uses *much* less kernel memory than the standard mcd driver.
	o 	Plays audio like the `old' driver.

This version doesn't support yet:

	o	Shared IRQs, due to the fact that otherwise it wouldn't be
		possible to distinguish the drives issuing the interrupt in the 
		corresponding handling routine.

This driver never will:

	o	Read digital audio (i.e. copy directly), due to missing
		hardware features. 
	o	Do DMA transfers. This is simply far less efficient with such 
		a slow device. Further, the SoundBlaster interfaces doesn't
		support it, so it's not worth the effort.
