This is the README file for the Optics Storage 8000 AT CDROM device driver.

The driver contains code to enable an ISP16 interface if it finds one.  It
didn't originally (although this README erroneously said so), because I think
this kind of code should go into its own module. But having to use a hack all
the time in order to use a part of the standard kernel started to annoy me, so
I copied the ISP16 code by Eric van der Maarel (maarel@marin.nl) from Vadim
Model's Sanyo sjcd driver. I'll remove it again from this driver when we have
some common way to talk to ISP16 interfaces.

My original configuration code for the ISP-16 card can get found at
      dutette.et.tudelft.nl:/pub/linux/
and at Eberhard's mirror
      ftp.gwdg.de:/pub/linux/cdrom/drivers/optics/

Much more elaborate information can be found at ftp:rbrf.msk.su,
where Vadim Model (vadim@rbrf.msk.su) has made available an ISP16
device driver.
Vadim's directory is
      rbrf.msk.su:/linux/mediamagic/
and Eberhard is holding a mirror at
      ftp.gwdg.de:/pub/linux/cdrom/drivers/sanyo/


Before you can use the driver, you have to create the device file once:
 # mknod /dev/optcd0 b 17 0

To specify the base address if the driver is "compiled-in" to your kernel,
you can use the kernel command line item (LILO option)
             optcd=0x340
with the right address.

If you have compiled optcd as a module, you can load it with
 # insmod /usr/src/linux/modules/optcd.o
or
 # insmod /usr/src/linux/modules/optcd.o optcd=0x340
with the matching address value of your interface card.

I have tried the module with several 1.2.x kernel versions, and it seems to
work, as far as I tested. It also seems to work for several 1.3.x versions.
If you use it, I'd appreciate success/failure reports. If you find a bug,
try recompiling the driver with some strategically chosen #undef DEBUG_...'s
changed into #defines (you'll find them in .../include/linux/optcd.h) and
include the messages generated in your bug report. Good luck.
