ALS-007/ALS-100/ALS-200 based sound cards
=========================================

Support for sound cards based around the Avance Logic
ALS-007/ALS-100/ALS-200 chip is included.  These chips are a single
chip PnP sound solution which is mostly hardware compatible with the
Sound Blaster 16 card, with most differences occurring in the use of
the mixer registers.  For this reason the ALS code is integrated
as part of the Sound Blaster 16 driver (adding only 800 bytes to the
SB16 driver).

To use an ALS sound card under Linux, enable the following options in the
sound configuration section of the kernel config:
  - 100% Sound Blaster compatibles (SB16/32/64, ESS, Jazz16) support
  - FM synthesizer (YM3812/OPL-3) support 
Since the ALS-007/100/200 is a PnP card, the sound driver probably should be
compiled as a module, with the isapnptools used to wake up the sound card.
Set the "I/O base for SB", "Sound Blaster IRQ" and "Sound Blaster DMA" (8 bit -
either 0, 1 or 3) to the values used in your particular installation (they
should match the values used to configure the card using isapnp).  The
ALS-007 does NOT implement 16 bit DMA, so the "Sound Blaster 16 bit DMA"
should be set to -1.  If you wish to use the external MPU-401 interface on
the card, "MPU401 I/O base of SB16" and "SB MPU401 IRQ" should be set to
the appropriate values for your installation.  (Note that the ALS-007
requires a separate IRQ for the MPU-401, so don't specify -1 here).  (Note
that the base port of the internal FM synth is fixed at 0x388 on the ALS007; 
in any case the FM synth location cannot be set in the kernel configuration).

The resulting sound driver will provide the following capabilities:
  - 8 and 16 bit audio playback
  - 8 and 16 bit audio recording
  - Software selection of record source (line in, CD, FM, mic, master)
  - Record and playback of midi data via the external MPU-401
  - Playback of midi data using inbuilt FM synthesizer
  - Control of the ALS-007 mixer via any OSS-compatible mixer programs. 
    Controls available are Master (L&R), Line in (L&R), CD (L&R), 
    DSP/PCM/audio out (L&R), FM (L&R) and Mic in (mono).
