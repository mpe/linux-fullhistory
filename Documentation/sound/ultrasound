insmod sound
insmod ad1848
insmod gus io=* irq=* dma=* ...

This loads the driver for the Gravis Ultrasound familily of soundcards.

The gus modules takes the following arguments

io		I/O address of the ultrasound card (eg. io=0x220)
irq		IRQ of the soundblaster card 
dma     	DMA channel for the soundblaster
dma16   	2nd DMA channel, only needed for full duplex operation
type		1 for PnP card
gus16		1 for using 16 bit sampling daughter board
no_wave_dma	Set to disable dma usage for wavetable (see note)
db16		???


no_wave_dma option

This option defaults to a value of 0, which allows the Ultrasound wavetable
DSP to use DMA for for playback and downloading samples. This is the same
as the old behaviour. If set to 1, no DMA is needed for downloading samples,
and allows owners of a GUS MAX to make use of simultanious digital audio
(/dev/dsp), MIDI, and wavetable playback.


If you have problems in recording with GUS MAX, you could try to use
just one 8 bit DMA channel. Recording will not work with one DMA
channel if it's a 16 bit one.
