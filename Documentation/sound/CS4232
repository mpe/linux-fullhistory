insmod sound
insmod ad1848
insmod uart401
insmod cs4232 io=* irq=* dma=* dma2=*

This configures the crystal CS423x sound chip and activates its DSP
functions. On some cards the non PnP setup the board attempts to do fails.
If you have problems use the kernel PnP facilities.

io is the I/O address of the WSS (normally 0x534)
irq is the IRQ of this device
dma/dma2 are the DMA channels. DMA2 may well be 0


To get midi synth facilities add

insmod opl3 io=*

io= I/O address of the OPL3 synthesizer. This will be shown in /proc/sys/pnp
and is normally 0x388
