  TESTERS WANTED.

  ksymoops handles ix86.  It appears to handle Alpha, Sparc, M68K, PPC,
  MIPS but I have no machine to test on.  I would appreciate feedback
  from users of non ix86 machines.  In particular, it would be nice if
  you could run

   ksymoops -VMO -k /proc/ksyms -dd <oops.file >/tmp/ksymoops.log 2>&1

  and mail /tmp/ksymoops.log to kaos@ocs.com.au

  TODO:
  Clean up these docs.
  Tweak System.map to include arch information.
  Tweak modutils to log at least one symbol for each module loaded,
  otherwise they are invisible to ksymoops.  Also arch and version data.
  Include sparc/sparc64 patches from Jakub Jelinek <jj@sunsite.mff.cuni.cz>.
  Add object format override for sparc/soparc64 or any cross platform
  oops debugging.

  m68k code based on ksymoops.cc changes by
    Andreas Schwab <schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>

  This code subsumes the Perl script make_System.map.pl which is no longer
  supported.

  Why another ksymoops I hear you ask?  Various complaints about
  ksymoops.cc -

  * It requires C++.
  * It has hard wired limitations on the number of symbols.
  * It does not handle modules at all.
  * Very rigid requirements on the format of input, especially the Oops
    log.
  * No cross checking between ksyms, modules, System.map etc.
  * Very little error checking, diagnostics are not suitable for
    beginners.
  * It only prints the trace and decoded code, users have to manually
    extract the other lines from the Oops.
  * Gives up on the slightest problem.
  * Only handles i386 and possibly m68k.  The code is difficult to extend
    to other architectures.
  * Stops after the first Oops, you have to manually extract each one and
    run through ksymoops one at a time.

  This version is -
  * C.
  * No hard wired limitations (malloc as far as the eye can see).
  * Handles modules by default.
  * Uses regular pattern matching so it is a lot more forgiving about
    input formats.
  * By default, cross checks ksyms, modules, System.map and vmlinux.
  * Lots of diagnostics and error checking.
  * Prints all relevant lines for a complete Oops report.
  * Tries to provide output no matter how bad the input is.  The level of
     progress and error reporting is aimed at beginners.
  * Handles i386, alpha, sparc, m68k.  It is a lot easier to extend to
    other architectures (patches and/or sample data gratefully accepted).
  * Handles all Oops in the input file(s).


  Usage:	ksymoops
		  [-v vmlinux]	Where to read vmlinux
		  [-V]		No vmlinux is available
		  [-o object_dir]	Directory containing modules
		  [-O]		No modules is available
		  [-k ksyms]	Where to read ksyms
		  [-K]		No ksyms is available
		  [-l lsmod]	Where to read lsmod
		  [-L]		No lsmod is available
		  [-m system.map]	Where to read System.map
		  [-M]		No System.map is available
		  [-s save.map]	Save consolidated map
		  [-c code_bytes]	How many bytes in each unit of code
		  [-1]		One shot toggle (exit after first Oops)
		  [-d]		Increase debug level by 1
		  [-h]		Print help text
		  Oops.file	Oops to decode

	  All flags can occur more than once.  With the exception of -o
	  and -d which are cumulative, the last occurrence of each flag is
	  used.  Note that "-v my.vmlinux -V" will be taken as "No vmlinux
	  available" but "-V -v my.vmlinux" will read my.vmlinux.  You
	  will be warned about such combinations.

	  Each occurrence of -d increases the debug level.

	  Each -o flag can refer to a directory or to a single object
	  file.  If a directory is specified then all *.o files in that
	  directory and its subdirectories are assumed to be modules.

	  If any of the vmlinux, object_dir, ksyms or system.map options
	  contain the string *r (*m, *n, *s) then it is replaced at run time
	  by the current value of `uname -r` (-m, -n, -s).

	  The defaults can be changed in the Makefile, typical options are

	  Defaults:	  -V
			  -o /lib/modules/%r
			  -k /proc/ksyms
			  -l /proc/modules
			  -m /usr/src/linux/System.map
			  -c 1
			  Oops report is read from stdin

  Note:	  Unless you tell ksymoops *NOT* to read a particular file, it
	  will try to read and reconcile almost all possible sources of kernel
	  symbol information.  This is intended for beginners, they just
	  type

	    ksymoops < /var/log/syslog

	  no thinking required.  Experts can point at different files or
	  suppress the input from selected files.  For example, if you
	  save /proc/ksyms before doing a test that creates an Oops, you
	  can point ksymoops at the saved ksyms instead of using
	  /proc/ksyms.

	  vmlinux is not read by default, it only duplicates the
	  information in System.map.  If you want to read vmlinux as well
	  as or instead of System.map, use -v.

	  To get the equivalent of the old ksymoops.cc (no vmlinux, no
	  modules objects, no ksyms, no System.map) just do ksymoops
	  -VOKLM.  Or to just read System.map, ksymoops -VOKL -m mapfile.


  Return codes:	  0 - normal.
		  1 - error(s) or warning(s) issued, results may not be
		      reliable.
		  2 - fatal error, no useful results.
		  3 - One shot mode, end of input reached.

  Supported architectures

	  i386 tested.
          m68k code derived from ksymoops.cc and reading traps.c, untested.
	  MIPS tested.
	  Sparc tested.
	  Alpha tested.
	  ARM tested.

	  The term "eip" is generic, for example it includes the i386 EIP
	  and the m68k PC.  Remember that objdump output always says EIP,
	  no matter what the architecture, see objfile_head.

	  To support another arch, check the Oops_ procedures between
	  'Start architecture sensitive code' and 'End architecture
	  sensitive code'.

	  The pattern matching should take care of different lengths for
	  the address, i.e. addresses should not be arch sensitive.  I
	  assume that all addresses are at least 4 characters.

	  If nm output has a different format on your arch, check for uses
	  of re_nm.



  Because ksymoops reads kernel information from multiple sources, there
  could be mismatches.  ksymoops does the following cross checks, but only
  if the specified files exist -

  * Compare Version_nnn numbers from all sources against each other.  Pity
    that only vmlinux and System.map have these symbols (as at 2.1.125),
    however I check ksyms, modules and Oops as well.  If somebody adds
    symbol Version_nnn to ksyms or modules or adds a Version_nnn line to
    the Oops log, this code is ready.

  * Compare kernel ksyms against vmlinux.  vmlinux takes precedence.

  * Compare System.map against vmlinux.   vmlinux takes precedence.

  * Compare vmlinux against System.map.   vmlinux takes precedence.

  * Compare kernel ksyms against System.map.  System.map takes precedence.

  * Compare modules against module ksyms.  modules take precedence.  Only
    if at least one module appears in ksyms.

  * Compare module names in ksyms against lsmod.  Warn if a module
    appears in lsmod but not in ksyms.  Error if a modules appears in
    ksyms but is not in lsmod.  Only if both ksyms and lsmod have being
    read.

  The precedence order is somewhat arbitrary, however it only applies if
  there is any difference between the various sources.

  Handling modules is awkward.  They can be loaded under different names
  (insmod -o dummy1 dummy.o) and the text, data and read only data are
  loaded at different offsets.  Although you can give the -m option to
  insmod which will output the module map when it is loaded, this has a
  few problems -

  * No equivalent for removing a module.  If you load and remove a lot of
    modules, you end up with multiple sets of symbols around the same
    offsets, which set is correct?

  * "insmod -o dummy1 dummy.o" still reports as dummy.  That is, there is
     no way of telling which particular version of a multiply loaded
     module the insmod output refers to.  Therefore there is no way of
     telling which instantiation failed.

  * Even if the above problems are fixed, how do you tell what the module
    environment looked like when the Oops occurred?  What if a module is
    loaded or removed just after Oops, how is the user expected to edit
    the insmod log?  Rule 1 - make ksymoops easy for beginners.

  Although those problems could be fixed, they require changes to
  modutils.  Working from ksyms and the module objects can be done without
  changing modutils and without confusing beginners.
  
  Alas the ksyms plus object approach has another problem - matching ksyms
  to module objects.  Nowhere does the kernel say that module dummy1 came
  from module /lib/modules/2.1.215/net/dummy.o, ksyms just says dummy1.  I
  have to match ksyms to the relevant object by finding a globally unique
  external symbol in each module that can be used to map to the external
  symbols in ksyms.  This assumes that each module exports at least one
  text symbol that is unique amongst all modules.

  It may not be possible to correctly map other sections such as data and
  readonly data for modules because they may not have exported symbols.
  Since the main aim of ksymoops is to map a code Oops, this should not be
  a problem.

  Unfortunately some modules export no symbols.  They are marked as
  EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS are simply do not export anything.  It is
  impossible to detect these in ksyms because, by definition, ksyms
  only contains exported symbols for modules.  Since all modules appear
  in lsmod (/proc/modules), a cross check of lsmod against the module
  names will find loaded modules with no symbols, at least I can warn
  about these.

  After merging the various sources, ksymoops has a (hopefully) accurate
  map including modules.  The -s option lets you save the merged
  System.map, but remember that module data and readonly data sections may
  not be correctly relocated, see above.

  Environment Variables.
  KSYMOOPS_NM		path for nm, defaults to /usr/bin/nm.
  KSYMOOPS_FIND		path for find, defaults to /usr/bin/find.
  KSYMOOPS_OBJDUMP	path for objdump, defaults to /usr/bin/objdump.


  Input Oops data.

  The ideal input is to feed the syslog straight into this program.  If
  you cannot do that, you need to know what the program looks for.
  Especially if you are typing in the Oops by hand :(.  All input is case
  insensitive.

  * White space in this context means space or tab.  It does not include
    newline.

  * Oops in syslog has a syslog prefix.  Leading text up to and including
    ' kernel: ' is always ignored, there is no need to edit syslog first.
    This leading text need not exist but if it does, it must end in
    ' kernel: '.

  * An alternative prefix is <n> where n is the kernel print level.  Also
    ignored if present.

  * Leading white space is treated as a prefix and ignored, the input is
    not indentation sensitive.

  * In the following paragraphs, assume that any prefixes have been
    skipped.  If there is more than one prefix, all are skipped, no matter
    which order they appear in.

  * A bracketed address is optional '[', required '<', at least 4 hex
    digits, required '>', optional ']'.  For example [<01234567>] or
    <1234>.

  * The ix86 EIP line is identified by optional white space followed by
    'EIP:', followed by a least one white space, followed by a bracketed
    address.

  * The m68k PC line is identified by optional white space followed by
    'PC', optionally followed by white space, followed by '=', optionally
    followed by white space, followed by a bracketed address.

  * The sparc PC line starts with PSR and PC is the second hex value, not
    bracketed.

  * A call trace line is identified by 'Call Trace:' followed by at least
    one white space.  Or it is a line starting with a bracketed address,
    but only if the previous line was a call trace line (I hate multi line
    output that relies on identation for recognition, especially when
    lines can have a variable prefix).

  * The Code line is identified by 'Code:' followed by a least one white
    space character followed by at least one hex value.  The line can
    contain multiple hex values, each separated by at least one white
    space.  Each hex value must be 2 to 8 digits and must be a multiple of
    2 digits.

    On some architectures the Code: data is a stream of single bytes,
    in machine order.  On other architectures, it is a stream of shorts
    or ints in human readable order which does not always match the
    machine order, endianess raises its ugly head.  We are consistently
    inconsistent.

    To cater for these architecture inconsistencies, use the -c option.
    If the Code: line is already in machine order, use -c 1.  If the
    Code: data is a stream of shorts or ints which do not match the
    machine order, use -c 2 or -c 4.  Each set of 'c' bytes are swapped
    to (hopefully) reflect the machine order.

    Special cases where Code: can be followed by text.
      'Code: general protection'
      'Code: <n>'
    Dump the data anyway, the code was unavailable.

  * Formatted data is only output when the Code: line is seen.  If any
    data has been stored and more than 5 lines other than Oops text (see
    Oops_print) or end of file are encountered then ksymoops assumes that
    the Code: line is missing or garbled and dumps the formatted data
    anyway.  Fail safe, I hope.

  * By default, ksymoops reads its entire input file.  If the -1 toggle
    is set, it will run in one shot mode and exit after the first Oops.
    This is useful for automatically mailing reports as they happen,
    like this :-

    #!/bin/sh
    # ksymoops1
    while (true)
    do
    	ksymoops -1 > $HOME/oops1
	if [ $? -eq 3 ]
	then
	   exit 0
	fi
	mail -s Oops admin < $HOME/oops1
    done

    tail -f /var/log/messages | ksymoops1

    Restarting after log rotation is left as an exercise for the reader.
