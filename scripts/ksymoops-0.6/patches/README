An ad-hoc collection of patches to the Linux kernel and related
utilities, to make the best use of ksymoops.

Most of the kernel patches are to extend the information logged on an
Oops, some architectures currently (2.1.126) do not provide full
diagnostics.  Hopefully these patches will be integrated into the
kernel tree in future.  ksymoops will still run without these patches
but will provide degraded output.

mips    - Kernel patch by Ulf Carlsson <ulfc@bun.falkenberg.se> to
          provide full diagnostics on a mips Oops.

ppc     - Kernel patch by "Ryan Nielsen" <ran@krazynet.com> to provide
          full diagnostics on a ppc Oops.
