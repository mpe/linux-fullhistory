config SECURITY_SELINUX
	bool "NSA SELinux Support"
	depends on SECURITY
	default n
	help
	  This selects NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux).
	  You will also need a policy configuration and a labeled filesystem.
	  You can obtain the policy compiler (checkpolicy), the utility for
	  labeling filesystems (setfiles), and an example policy configuration
	  from http://www.nsa.gov/selinux.
	  SELinux needs to be explicitly enabled on the kernel command line with
	  selinux=1.  If you specify selinux=0 or do not use this parameter,
	  SELinux will not be enabled.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_DEVELOP
	bool "NSA SELinux Development Support"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	default y
	help
	  This enables the development support option of NSA SELinux,
	  which is useful for experimenting with SELinux and developing
	  policies.  If unsure, say Y.  With this option enabled, the
	  kernel will start in permissive mode (log everything, deny nothing)
	  unless you specify enforcing=1 on the kernel command line.  You
	  can interactively toggle the kernel between enforcing mode and
	  permissive mode (if permitted by the policy) via /selinux/enforce.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_MLS
	bool "NSA SELinux MLS policy (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX && EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	help
	  This enables the NSA SELinux Multi-Level Security (MLS) policy in
	  addition to the default RBAC/TE policy.  This policy is
	  experimental and has not been configured for use.  Unless you
	  specifically want to experiment with MLS, say N.
