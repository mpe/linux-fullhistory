# This script is used to configure the linux kernel.

# It was inspired by the challenge in the original Configure script
# to ``do something better'', combined with the actual need to ``do
# something better'' because the old configure script wasn't flexible
# enough.

# 050793 - use IFS='@' to get around a bug in a pre-version of bash-1.13
# with an empty IFS.

#
# Make sure we're really running bash.
#
# I would really have preferred to write this script in a language with
# better string handling, but alas, bash is the only scripting language
# that I can be reasonable sure everybody has on their linux machine.
